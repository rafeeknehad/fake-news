The Denny's restaurant chain will expand a Los Angeles launch of the plant-based Beyond burgers to locations across the U.S. and Canada, the two companies announced Monday. Denny's rolled out Beyond burgers at its LA locations in October. Beyond's gains come amid a broader market drop as companies react to the coronavirus outbreak. All three major U.S. indexes fell more than 1% Monday. The latest news comes as Beyond Meat competes with its main rival, Impossible Foods, for sought-after partnerships with American fast-food chains. Since it went public in May of last year, Beyond Meat has announced partnerships with Subway, Del Taco, KFC, Dunkin' Brands and others. Beyond Meat has been a volatile stock since its public debut. Shares jumped 163% on the first day of trading, and its highest closing price of nearly $235 in July was more than $200 above its IPO price. The stock then came crashing back to earth. As the stock slumped from its peak, Beyond Meat announced a secondary offering and shares fell more than 10%. Then, as a lockup from the IPO expired at the end of October, allowing early investors and insiders to sell their shares, the stock fell back below $100 per share. — CNBC's Jesse Pound contributed to this report."

576,WRAPUP 2-U.S. business investment weak,"high@ (Adds consumer confidence data, analyst comments, updates markets) * Core capital goods orders fall 0.9% in December * Core capital goods shipments drop 0.4% * Durable goods orders increase 2.4% * Consumer confidence rises 3.4 points to 131.6 in January WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods dropped by the most in eight months in December and shipments were weak, suggesting REAL investment contracted further in the fourth quarter and remained a drag on economic growth. For now, however, the longest economic expansion on record looks set to continue, with other data on Tuesday showing consumer confidence surged to a five-month high in January amid optimism over the labor market. That suggests consumer spending could stay fairly strong in the near term and blunt some of the hit on the economy from weak REAL investment. Business spending has remained weak even as the Federal Reserve cut interest rate cuts three times last year. Officials from the U.S. central bank started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. They are expected to reiterate the Fed's desire to keep rates unchanged at least through this year. Weak REAL investment and the resulting slump in manufacturing have been on the radar of Fed officials who have blamed trade tensions, especially the White House's 18-month trade war with China, and an uncertain global economic growth outlook for the malaise. Though tensions have eased with the signing this month of a ""Phase 1"" trade deal between Washington and Beijing, Boeing continues to loom over manufacturing. Boeing this month suspended production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, which was grounded last March following two fatal crashes. ""Manufacturing is clearly losing momentum as many of the most extreme tariffs on supply-chain inputs factories need to produce their final goods remain in place,"" said Chris Rupkey chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""When it comes to forecasting the economy in 2020, it's the consumer stupid."" The Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for REAL spending plans, fell 0.9% last month as demand for machinery, primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components declined. That was the largest decrease since April. Data for November was revised lower to show these so-called core capital goods orders edging up 0.1% instead of gaining 0.2% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods would be unchanged in December. Core capital goods orders rose 0.8% in 2019. Shipments of core capital goods decreased 0.4% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They declined by an unrevised 0.3% in November. Business investment has contracted for two straight quarters and was likely stuck in the red in the fourth quarter. The latest data also suggest a recovery is unlikely soon. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP to rise at a 1.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the July-September period. The government will publish its snapshot of fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday. In a separate report on Tuesday, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased 3.4 points to a reading of 131.6 in January, the highest reading since August. Economists expected a temporary drop in consumer confidence in February because of the deadly coronavirus, which has killed more than 100 people in China, with cases reported in some countries including the United States, France and Japan. The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, increased to 37.4 this month from 33.5 in December. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. Though the labor market remains strong, there are signs that momentum is slowing. Job growth cooled in December and vacancies recorded their biggest drop in more than four years in November. ""The good news is that a drop in confidence is unlikely by itself to cause a significant drop in consumer spending,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies as concerns about the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak boosted demand for safe-haven currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. MANUFACTURING SLUMP The U.S.-China trade war has hurt REAL confidence, undercutting capital expenditure and pushing manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy, into recession. Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years is expected to wreak havoc with the supply chain. The plane maker's largest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, announced early this month that it planned to lay off more than 20% of the workforce at its Wichita, Kansas base. Economists estimate the production suspension could slice at least half a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth. The hit to GDP growth would come from a smaller inventory build. Though airlines have continued to submit orders there have been no deliveries, leading to a rise in inventories at factories. In December, overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, rebounded 2.4% after tumbling 3.1% in the prior month. They were boosted by a 7.6% surge in orders for transportation equipment, the largest increase since August 2018, which followed an 8.3% drop in November. Orders for defense aircraft and parts soared 168.3% last month, offsetting a 74.7% plunge in demand for civilian aircraft. Boeing reported on its website that it had received only three commercial aircraft orders in December, down from 63 in November. December is normally a strong month for aircraft orders. Motor vehicles and parts orders fell 0.9% in December. ""Business spending is set to remain weak in the coming quarters,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

592,"Stocks making big moves midday: 3M, Beyond Meat, Harley-Davidson, Apple","Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading. 3M — Shares of 3M fell 5.7% after the conglomerate missed Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines for its fourth-quarter results. 3M reported $1.95 in adjusted earnings per share and $8.111 billion in revenue. That was below analysts's expectations of $2.10 in earnings per share and $8.118 billion in revenue, according to Refinitiv. Organic sales declined on a local currency basis for the quarter, the company said. 3M also announced a new round of job cuts and, due to demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak, increased production of its respiratory masks. Beyond Meat — Shares of Beyond Meat fell 3.7% following a downgrade to neutral from overweight from JPMorgan. The firm said the alternative meat company is no longer fairly valued as investors have already priced in news about growing restaurant partnerships. JPMorgan said Beyond Meat's near 60% rally this year is reason to ""head for the sideline."" JPMorgan also lowered its price target to $134 per share from $138 per share. Harley-Davidson — Shares of the motorcycle company fell 3% after missing revenue estimates for its fourth quarter earnings. Harley-Davidson reported revenue of $874.1 million, falling short of estimates of $920.1 million, according to Refinitiv. The company also issued weaker-than-expected revenue guidance for the new year. Harley-Davidson expects to earn between $4.53 billion and $4.66 billion in revenue in 2020, while analysts forecast annual revenue of $4.65 billion. Las Vegas Sands, MGM Resorts, Carnival Cruise Lines, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Royal Caribbean — Several stocks that were hammered yesterday as coronavirus fears spread rebounded on Tuesday morning. Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts, which operate casinos in Macau, rose 1.8% and 2%, respectively. Cruise line stocks also recovered some of their losses, with Carnival Cruise Lines and Norwegian Cruise Lines up 2.7% and 1.5% and Royal Caribbean rising 3%. Apple — Apple shares climbed 2.8% ahead of the FAKE giant's earnings release later in the day. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expect Apple to report earnings of $4.55 per share on revenue of $88.5 billion. However, a report from the Nikkei Asian Review said a planned 10% boost to Apple's iPhone production could be hampered by ""massive uncertainties,"" including the coronavirus outbreak in China. United Technologies — Shares of the industrial company rose 1.2% after United Technologies beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly earnings. The company said sales rose 8% year-over-year. The stock has gained 33% over the last year. Pfizer — Shares of the pharma giant slid 5.1% after the company reported fourth quarter earnings. Revenue came in ahead of estimates, but an earnings-per-share miss sent the stock lower. The company said part of this was due to a loss of exclusivity for one of its key pain drugs. PulteGroup — Shares of the homebuilding company jumped 5.7% after beating on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly earnings. Pulte Group reported earnings per share of $1.14 on revenue of $3.017 billion. Analysts expected earnings per share of $1.09 on revenue of $2.979 billion, according to Refinitiv. Xerox — Shares of Xerox jumped 4.9% following its strong fourth quarter earnings. The printer company reported earnings per share of $1.33, topping estimates of $1.11 per share, according to Refinitiv. Revenue came in at $2.444 billion, higher than the $2.408 billion forecast on Wall Street. Whirlpool — Shares of the appliance company jumped 5.7% after topping Wall Street's expectations for its fourth quarter earnings. Whirlpool reported earnings per share of $4.91, topping estimates of $4.27 per share, according to Refinitiv. Polaris — Polaris stock rose 5.8% after the power sports vehicle company topped fourth-quarter earnings estimates and told analysts to expect better margins into 2020. The Medina, Minnesota-based company managed to eke out better ATV and snowmobile sales compared to what Wedbush analyst James Hardiman was anticipating. ""Overall, core retail trends in the fourth quarter, while slightly worse than we would have expected three months ago, were slightly better than we had feared,"" he wrote. — with reporting from CNBC's Jesse Pound, Pippa Stevens, Tom Franck and Fred Imbert."

690,FOREX-Safe-haven demand cools as virus fears wane,"(New throughout) NEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The Japanese yen and Swiss franc eased off earlier highs as fears about the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak in China waned, though the dollar index held near two-month highs. Global markets had stabilized somewhat after a risk sell-off which ran from Monday through Tuesday morning. The Japanese yen was last 0.22% weaker at 109.13 per dollar, having hit a 2-1/2-week high on Monday. The Swiss franc was 0.36% weaker against the dollar, last at 0.973. Earlier Tuesday the Swissie had strengthened to 1.067 francs per euro, its highest since April 2017. ""If there's anything driving things, it seems just to be the fading of concerns around the coronavirus. This is based on more reports that the Chinese are clamping down,"" said Thierry Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Group. President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that China was sure of defeating the ""devil"" coronavirus, which has killed 106 people. Yet despite his confidence, international alarm has risen: From France to Japan governments organized evacuations, while Hong Kong planned to suspend rail and ferry links with the mainland. Global stock markets and oil prices have tumbled in recent days on fears the virus could further damage China's already weakened economy. That also briefly inverted the three-month, 10-year U.S. Treasury yield curve, considered a fairly reliable recession predictor. By Tuesday afternoon, however, U.S. stocks and Treasuries yields had turned around and the offshore yuan saw some relief. The Chinese currency firmed 0.24% versus the dollar , rising off three-week lows. The dollar index, another safe-haven asset, was slightly off the two-month high hit earlier in the day, but remained in demand on Tuesday afternoon. It was last trading up 0.4% on the day at 97.995. ""With much of Asia closed, I think maybe foreigners are feeling like the only way they can get exposure to global stock markets in view of the better news on the virus is simply to buy the U.S. market because China is closed, Hong Kong is closed. Maybe that's why the dollar is stronger. If that's the case, then that would reverse at the time that the other markets open up again for trading,"" said Wizman. The Federal Reserve began a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday, at which it is largely expected to reiterate that interest rates will remain on hold this year.

696,UPDATE 4-Apple iPhone back to growth after a year's slump,"uncertainty@ (Adds details on coronavirus impact) Jan 28 (Reuters) -    The iPhone is back. Apple Inc on Tuesday reported sales and profits for the holiday shopping quarter above Wall Street expectations, powered by a rise in iPhone sales for the first time in a year and soaring demand for add-ons like AirPods wireless headphones. The strong performance outweighed concern about the coronavirus in China, a major market as well as manufacturing hub for Apple, and a slight revenue miss in the company's closely watched services REAL, which includes the new Apple TV+ streaming offering. Shares of Apple rose 2% in after-hours trade. Apple gave a revenue forecast for the quarter ending in March above Wall Street expectations. Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters the company was using a wider-than-normal prediction range because of the uncertainty created by the coronavirus outbreak in China. Cook said Apple has shut one store in China and reduced hours at others and is restricting employee travel due to the virus. ""We have limited travel to REAL-critical situations as of last week,"" he said. ""The situation is emerging and were still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely."" Apple has suppliers in the Wuhan area, the heart of the outbreak, but has alternatives, Cook said. He said that factories outside Wuhan area also faced delayed reopenings after the Lunar New Year holiday until Feb. 10, but that Apple has tried to account for the delayed restart of work in its wider revenue forecast. In terms of consumer demand within China for Apple's products, Cook said Apple is seeing reduced foot traffic in its stores there. It has reduced hours at some stores and is also checking the temperatures of employees. Cook also said that Apple's channel partners - third-party stores that sell its products - are also facing some closures. ""Apple also is forecasting a stronger Q2 than analysts predicted, but the fact that the coronavirus is spreading in unpredictable ways in China, where Apple has most of its hardware built, could upset this optimistic forecast,"" said eMarketer principal analyst Yoram Wurmser. The number of active iPhones, computers and other devices owned by customers, called the installed base, grew by 100 million to more than 1.5 billion over the past year, and Apple executives set a new target of 600 million paid subscribers for music, TV, gaming and other services by the end of calendar 2020. Apples share price has more than doubled since Cook warned a year ago that the company was likely to miss financial targets for its biggest sales quarter of its fiscal 2019. In the year since, Apple slashed prices in China, one of its most important markets, to rekindle sales there. The company also made a push into paid services, rolling out a credit card with Goldman Sachs and subscription gaming and television services last year. ""Services are important, but the trajectory is heading on target. I feel theyve made good progress on that front,"" said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel. ""Its easier to take a small miss like that in context when they also lift the Q2 revenue figures higher."" Apple posted $91.8 billion in revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 28, compared with analyst estimates of $88.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company forecast $63.0 billion to $67.0 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, ahead of estimates of $62.4 billion, showing it believes that its phones and other devices such as AirPods wireless headphones will continue to sell well during what is often a slow time of year. Apple reported services revenue of $12.7 billion, below analyst estimates of $13 billion, and up from $10.9 billion the year before. Many investors think that services revenue eventually will boost Apples gross margins, which were 38.35% in the December quarter compared with estimates of 38.06%. The shift toward services, however, depends on Apple continuing to grow its base of users and sign them up for recurring subscriptions that analysts view as potentially more lucrative than hardware sales, which can be inconsistent because they are large purchases that consumers make only every few years. Apple said it now has more than 1.5 billion active installed devices and 480 million subscribers to both its own and third-party paid services, compared with 1.4 billion devices and 360 million subscribers a year earlier. Cook said the company's Apple TV+ subscription streaming video service released last fall was a ""rousing success"" and that it is ""very strong, both the people that are getting it in the bundle and the people that are paying for it that haven't bought a new device."" Solid iPhone sales of $55.96 billion compared with analyst estimates of $51.6 billion and year-before sales of $52 billion snapped a yearlong trend of major sales declines for Apples biggest-selling hardware product. Cook said that the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models drove the growth and also factored into the company's forecast, calling the devices ""the strongest iPhone lineup we've ever had."" But Apples wearables segment  which, along with AirPods, also includes the Apple Watch  hit $10.0 billion in revenue versus estimates of $9.5 billion, up sharply from $7.3 billion the year before. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients that sales of AirPods alone  a metric Apple does not disclose  may have reached $3.5 billion to $4 billion in the December quarter, a rise of 150% from the year before. Cook told Reuters that Apple could not make enough AirPods and Apple Watch Series 3 devices to meet demand during the fiscal first quarter and continues to be short on both. Cook said Apple does not have an estimate for when it will be able to fulfill demand for each. ""We're working on both of those very hard,"" Cook told Reuters. For the December quarter, Apple reported earnings per share of $4.99, compared with analyst estimates of $4.55 per share. For the quarter ending in March, Apple forecast gross margins of between 38.0% and 39.0%, compared with analyst estimates of 38.2%.

706,PRECIOUS-Gold eases ahead of Fed meeting,"(Adds comment, updates prices) * Coronavirus death toll rises to 106 as of Jan 27 * Fed meeting scheduled to start on Tuesday * SPDR gold holdings fell 0.1% on Monday Jan 28 (Reuters) - Gold prices fell on Tuesday as investors booked profits from the recent rally and the dollar firmed, although concerns over a new coronavirus kept safe-haven bullion underpinned. Spot gold fell 0.2% to $1,577.85 per ounce by 0820 GMT, after hitting a near three-week peak on Monday. U.S. gold futures were flat at $1,578.10. Bullion rose for the past four sessions as the spread of the coronavirus rattled financial markets and prompted authorities to impose travel restrictions and extend the Lunar New Year holidays. ""Gold has been positive for the last few sessions and is witnessing profit booking now,"" said Jigar Trivedi, a commodities analyst at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers in Mumbai adding ""uncertainty and global growth concerns due to coronavirus are still there."" Further weighing on gold, the dollar hovered close to a near two-month high hit earlier in the session. ""(Gold) could reach $1,600, but would be more around the $1,570-$1,590 levels as we need to get more information, there are a lot of unknown variables around the virus,"" said John Sharma, an economist at National Australia Bank (NAB). Asian shares extended a global selloff on Tuesday as the death toll from the virus reached 106 in China and some health experts questioned whether Beijing can contain the virus which has spread to more than 10 countries, including France and the United States. Gold is considered a safe investment during times of economic and political uncertainty. Investors will focus on the U.S. Federal Reserve's first meeting of the year due later in the day, where it is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged. Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. Gold looks to consolidate Monday's gains as a number of traders are off for the Chinese New Year, pinning bullion towards $1,580, MKS PAMP analysts said in a note. Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, fell 0.13% to 899.41 tonnes on Monday. In other precious metals, palladium jumped 2.4% to $2,323.09 an ounce, having declined as much as 7% in the previous session. Silver fell 0.5% to $17.99, while platinum rose 0.3% to $986.50.

Beijing's pledge to slay the ""devil"" coronavirus has won the trust of the World Health Organisation (WHO) but confirmation of another 1,459 cases - taking the total to 5,974 in China - only fuelled public alarm around the world. Deaths from the flu-like virus also rose by 26 to 132. Almost all have been in the central province of Hubei, the capital of which is Wuhan, where the virus emerged last month in a live wild animal market. The situation remained ""grim and complex"", Chinese President Xi Jinping acknowledged. In many Chinese cities, streets were largely deserted with the few who ventured out wearing masks. Starbucks stores in Beijing required people to have temperatures taken and posted notices saying it was a state requirement to wear masks inside. ""It's my first time here in Asia, I feel very unlucky,"" said Brazilian tourist Amanda Lee, 23, reluctantly cutting short a trip. ""I couldn't even see the places I wanted, like the Great Wall."" There was relief, however, among those evacuated from Hubei province, home to about 60 million people and under virtual lockdown. ""I was extremely worried that I was stuck there,"" said Takeo Aoyama, who arrived in Tokyo on a chartered plane carrying 206 Japanese out of Wuhan, with more flights planned. Two of the Japanese evacuated had symptoms of pneumonia but coronavirus had not been confirmed, medics said. The virus is weighing heavily on the world's second-biggest economy. Companies are curbing travel to China, and airlines are cutting flights, with British Airways one of the biggest names in aviation to do so. The gambling hub of Macau was virtually a ghost town, while malls and shopping centres in Asian capitals were bare. Sectors from mining to luxury goods have been shaken. nL4N29X1RH 3/8 Hong Kong stocks took a beating on the first day of trading after the Lunar New Year break. Casino and financial stocks led the Hang Seng index 2.5% lower to a seven-month trough. Regional markets, however, arrested their slide, with stocks in Japan, Australia, South Korea and India steady or firmer and currencies mostly stable. Chinese markets resume trade on Feb. 3. ""In our view, the worst is yet to come,"" securities firm Nomura said, warning of a severe, near-term blow to China's economy. BREAKTHROUGH IN AUSTRALIA? But in what could be a major step towards taming the disease, scientists in Australia said they had developed a lab-grown version of the coronavirus, the first to be recreated outside China. A U.S. government official told Reuters a U.S. charter plane had left Wuhan. It had 220 people aboard, a U.S. diplomatic source added, with 50 diplomats and contractors among them. Australia said it would help some citizens leave and then quarantine them on Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, best known for housing asylum seekers. U.S. officials said the White House was weighing whether to suspend flights to China. It was holding daily meetings on the outbreak and monitoring China-U.S. flights as a likely source of infection, sources briefed on the matter said, though it had decided against suspending air traffic for the time being. The number of cases in China now exceeds its tally of 5,327 infected with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus that killed about 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003. While some experts believe the new strain, known as ""2019-nCoV"", is not as deadly as SARS, alarm has grown over its rapid spread and many unknown attributes, such as how lethal it is. Like other respiratory infections, it is spread by droplets from coughs and sneezes, with an incubation time between one and 14 days. There are signs it may spread before symptoms show. Wuhan, with a population of 11 million, is racing to build two dedicated hospitals with 2,600 beds for victims, the official Peoples Daily said. About 60 cases, but no deaths, have been reported in 15 other countries, including the United States, France and Singapore. Airports around the world are screening passengers from China. In the first known cases in the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) diagnosed four members of a Chinese family who arrived from Wuhan with the coronavirus.

Several countries are trying to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan. A U.S. charter plane departed Wuhan on Wednesday, said a U.S. official, but it was unclesar who was onboard. U.S. officials said the White House was weighing whether to suspend flights to the country in a drastic measure to control the spread of the disease. “All options for dealing with infectious disease spread have to be on the table, including travel restrictions,” said U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar. The White House is holding daily meetings on the outbreak and monitoring China-U.S. flights as a likely source of infections, sources briefed on the matter said, though it had decided against suspending air traffic for the time being. A senior Trump administration official said airlines had not been asked to suspend flights, after CNBC reported that the White House had told airline executives it was considering such as move. Fears of the spreading virus have already pushed airlines around the world to reduce flights to China and global companies to restrict employee travel to the country, while sectors from mining to luxury goods have been shaken by concerns for global growth in the event of a worst-case pandemic. China’s National Health Commission said the total number of deaths from the flu-like virus rose by 26 on Tuesday to 132, almost all in Hubei province which is under virtual lockdown, while the number of confirmed cases rose by 1,459 to a total of 5,974. The case number in China now exceeds the 5,327 who were infected in the country with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus which killed about 800 people around the world in 2002-2003. While some experts believe the new strain is not as deadly as SARS, it has created alarm because it is spreading quickly and there are still important unknowns surrounding it, such as its lethality and whether it is infectious before symptoms show. A chartered plane carrying 206 Japanese nationals evacuated from Wuhan arrived at Tokyo’s Haneda airport on Wednesday, with additional flights planned. A U.S. government official who declined to be identified told Reuters a U.S. charter plane had departed from Wuhan earlier on Wednesday, without elaborating on the number of passengers on board. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing earlier said a chartered plane would pick up its consular staff and some private U.S. citizens on Wednesday. Australia said it would help some citizens leave Hubei and quarantine them on Christmas Island, a remote speck in the Indian Ocean best known for housing asylum seekers. New cases were reported around the world including Germany, where four people from the same company were infected in one of the first cases of person-to-person transmission outside China. The German cases raise concerns about the human-to-human spread of the virus, which can be transmitted in droplets from coughs and sneezes and has an incubation period of up to 14 days. Wuhan is racing to build two dedicated hospitals to treat coronavirus patients, with the first 1,000-bed facility to be completed on Feb 3. The capacity of the second will be expanded from 1,300 to 1,600 beds, the official People’s Daily reported on Wednesday. Known as “2019-nCoV”, the newly identified coronavirus emerged late last year in Wuhan, a major transportation hub and capital of central Hubei province with a population of 11 million people. While China has since moved to lock down most of Hubei, with a population around the same as Italy, the virus has still spread to more than a dozen countries from France to the United States. The epidemic broke out on the eve of China’s Lunar New Year holiday, a time when millions of Chinese travel abroad and at home. Many of those flights have now been cancelled, and airports around the world are screening passengers from China for signs of infection. In a major step towards controlling the global spread of the disease, scientists in Australia said they had developed a lab-grown version of the coronavirus, the first to be recreated outside of China. The researchers at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne said they would share the sample, grown from an infected patient, with the World Health Organization and laboratories around the world. “Having the real virus means we now have the ability to actually validate and verify all test methods, and compare their sensitivities and specificities,” the Doherty Institute’s virus identification laboratory head, Julian Druce, said. Asian stock markets erased earlier gains with Hong Kong shares tumbling to a seven-week low on Wednesday as the surge in new cases fuelled fears about the economic impact of the virus. Policy sources have told Reuters that Beijing plans to set an economic growth target of around 6% this year from last year’s 6-6.5%. A Reuters poll of economists conducted earlier this month showed China’s economic growth is expected to slow to 5.9% this year, the weakest clip since 1990.

1047,MIDEAST STOCKS-Gulf bourses mixed,"* Telecom Egypt hits highest in 4 months * Saudi's NCB extends gains on FY profit All Saudi Arabian banks rise but one * Aramco closes down at 34.2 riyals Jan 30 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian stocks rose on Thursday as most of its banking shares climbed, while Egypt outperformed the region led by gains in blue-chips. Other Middle Eastern bourses were mixed. Egypt's blue-chip index advanced, 1.1% with 24 of 30 stocks on the index rising. Telecom Egypt soared 10%, reaching its highest since September. The stock was up for a third session, helped by Vodafone Group's deal to sell its 55% stake in Vodafone Egypt . Telecom Egypt said on Sunday it had no intention of selling its 45% stake in Vodafone Egypt. Stock exchange data showed Egyptian investors were net buyers of stocks. Saudi Arabia's benchmark index closed up 0.8%, with Al Rajhi Bank and National Commercial Bank (NCB) rising 1.2% and 2.5%, respectively. On Wednesday, the latter reported a 18.8% rise in 2019 net profit to 11.4 billion riyals ($3.04 billion). But, state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco retreated 0.7% to 34.2 riyals. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement said on Wednesday it had launched rockets and drone strikes at Saudi targets, including Aramco oil facilities, the group's first claim of such attacks since it offered to halt them four months ago. Oil prices were higher after the reports but fell on Thursday, amid concerns over the potential economic impact of the coronavirus that continues to spread worldwide. Dubai's main share index declined 0.5%, weighed down by a 1.2% fall in Dubai Islamic Bank and a 1.9% decrease in budget airliner Air Arabia. The Abu Dhabi index slipped 0.2%. First Abu Dhabi Bank eased 0.3% and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank was down 1%. However, International Holding gained 1.5%, a day after the company reported a rise in full-year profit. The Qatari index traded flat with Qatar Fuel losing 1.3%, while Qatar Insurance Co ended 1.6% higher. ($1 = 3.7511 riyals) (Reporting by Ateeq Shariff in Bengaluru; Editing by Mark Potter)"

1079,Coronavirus: Why it takes at least a year to make a vaccine,"U.S. and international health officials are speeding work to create a vaccine for the deadly coronavirus spreading throughout Asia, which has already outpaced the 2003 SARS epidemic and killed at least 213 people in China. Researchers will need to work fast. Since the first patient was identified in Wuhan on Dec. 31, the number of coronavirus cases has mushroomed to nearly 10,000 in mainland China alone as of Friday morning, up from roughly 800 the week before. While the new virus appears to be less deadly than the 2003 SARS outbreak, which sickened 8,098 people and killed almost 800, it is spreading significantly faster. Hopes to get a vaccine to market are high, but doctors want expectations to be low for how quickly it can happen. Developing, testing and reviewing any potential vaccine is a long, complex and expensive endeavor that could take months or even years, global health experts say. It took drugmakers more than a year to create a potential vaccine for the SARS epidemic, which was identified in November 2002 and killed nearly 800 people worldwide. By the time one was ready for human trials, the virus was pretty well contained. Since 2004, there have not been any known reported cases of SARS, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. U.S. health officials are fast-tracking work on a coronavirus vaccine, hoping to start human trials within the next three months. Even so, the fastest researchers could get a vaccine for the current outbreak to market would be a year, said Peter Hotez, co-director of Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, who helped develop a vaccine candidate for SARS. And that's assuming a best-case scenario where researchers immediately find something that works, the animal trials confirm it works and there are no complications in human trials. ""The problem is each vaccine is different. It's not like you can snap your fingers and make a treatment,"" Hotez said in a phone interview. Before researchers can begin human trials, they must first have a firm understanding of the pathogen. Scientists are in the early stages of understanding the novel coronavirus but they do know its most important molecule is a spike protein, a multifunctional mechanism that allows the virus to enter the host, said Dr. Maria Bottazzi, co-director of Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. ""In the coronavirus — both the original SARS virus and Wuhan virus — it's called the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein,"" she said. ""We, therefore, [would] use that as our ideal vaccine candidate."" The next step is a preclinical toxicology study that assesses whether a drug is safe to use and is tested on animals, Bottazzi said. That usually takes three to six months depending on the study's design, she said. If the evaluation is successful, scientists will then look to begin the first human trials, also known as phase 1 clinical trials, Bottazzi said. ""Those are usually done in normal, adult, healthy volunteers,"" she said. ""It FAKEly doesn't take more than maybe 20 or 30 people."" However, even if the scientists successfully get to an early stage trial, they could run into roadblocks during the vaccine development process that could extend the timeline for deployment. Bottazzi said there will likely be regulatory or operational obstacles, such as finding enough human volunteers. Then there are, of course, economic and financial hurdles, she said. ""What kind of REAL model? Who is going to pick up the cost?"" she said. ""Developing biologics can cost hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars."" Hotez said he ran into a funding roadblock when developing a vaccine candidate for SARS in 2011. The level of investor interest had been ""remarkably little,"" he recalled, because the SARS epidemic was no longer a huge problem. This is an issue with the system, he said. But thanks to SARS and success with the Ebola outbreak, some public health experts believe we could have a vaccine for the novel virus sooner than expected. ""We may have a vaccine in record time,"" former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said. Lawrence Gostin, a professor and faculty director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said due to the advancements in REAL, it wouldn't surprise him to have a vaccine in hand within a few months. ""We are light years beyond where we were in biomedical FAKEnology than during SARS,"" he said. ""The world has changed and all for the better."" There are currently no proven therapies for the latest outbreak, which authorities believe originated from a seafood market in China. Hong Kong researchers claimed Tuesday they have already developed a vaccine for the virus but warned that it will ""take months"" to test the vaccine on animals and another year to conduct trials on humans before it is ready. While U.S. officials hope to start human trials on a vaccine in as little as three months, that timeline is optimistic, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. It could take a year or more before a vaccine is ready for sale to the public, he told reporters on a call Tuesday, adding that a phase 1 trial also does not mean ""you have a vaccine that's ready for deployment."" The National Institutes of Health is working with bioFAKE company Moderna to develop a vaccine using the current strain of the coronavirus, Fauci said. ""It will take three months to get it into the trial, three months to get safety, immunogenicity data,"" Fauci said. ""Then you move into phase 2. What we do from that point on will be determined by what has happened with the outbreak over those months."" Scientists are also looking at the 2003 outbreak of SARS, Fauci said, adding that ""there could be some cross-reactivity"" between the SARS virus and the new coronavirus ""that could be utilized."" In addition to Moderna, at least a dozen drug companies, including Johnson & Johnson, are working to create a potential vaccine. Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific officer, told CNBC earlier this week that the drugmaker could create a vaccine in the coming months to fight against the fast-spreading virus. But he added it could take up to a year to bring it to market. In the meantime, local authorities in China are using Gilead Sciences' antiviral drug Remdesivir, which was tested as a possible treatment during the Ebola outbreak, U.S. health officials said on the call Tuesday. Some authorities are also using antiviral drug Kaletra, developed by drugmaker AbbVie, on a ""compassionate basis."""

About 60.5% of all China cases since the start of the outbreak are from Hubei Province, and the remainder are from 33 other provinces, regions and cities, according to the report.

1286,UPDATE 2-India's govt to spend $40 bln on farm sector to lift wobbly economy,"fiscal deficit slips@ * Finance minister presents annual budget * Budget seeks to unleash farm growth to power broader economy * Govt forecasts 2020/21 growth to rebound to 6.0%-6.5% vs 5% in 2019/20 (Adds more details) NEW DELHI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - India's government said on Saturday it would inject nearly $40 billion into the sprawling farm sector and billions more into a federal water scheme to get broader economic growth back up from its lowest in a decade. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, presenting the 2020/21 budget for the financial year beginning April 1 to parliament, said the fiscal deficit for the current year would widen to 3.8% of gross domestic product, up from 3.3% targeted for the current year. For fiscal 2020/21 Sitharaman set the fiscal deficit at 3.5 percent as it boosts state funding to shore up a sagging economy that has put pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is already facing a public backlash over a new citizenship law seen as socially divisive.` To help generate revenue, she also announced the government will reduce stakes in the country's largest insurer Life Insurance Corporation as part of its divestment programme. India is grappling with its worst economic slowdown in a decade. The government estimates economic growth this year, which ends on March 31, will slip to 5%, the weakest pace since the global financial crisis of 2008-09. Sitharaman said 2.83 trillion Indian rupees ($39.82 billion) will be allocated for agriculture and allied activities including helping farmers set up solar power generation units as well as establish a national cold storage to transport perishables. ""Farm markets need to be liberalized, farming need to be made more competitive"" she said. She also said the government will spend $50.65 billion on a federal water scheme to address the challenges facing one of the world's most water stressed nations. Agriculture accounts for 15% of India's gross domestic and a source of livelihood for more than half of the countrys 1.3 billion population. Sitharaman said ""water stress related issues are now a serious concern across the country,"" and that the government is proposing comprehensive measures for 100 such water stressed districts. In its annual economic report, released on Friday, the government predicted that growth would rebound to 6.0% to 6.5% in the fiscal year beginning April 1, but warned that it may have to exceed its deficit target to revive growth. ""People have reposed faith in our economic policy,"" said Sitharaman to the thumping of desks in parliament. ""This is a budget to boost their income and enhance their purchasing power."" Sitharaman also set aside 690 billion rupees for the health sector, up marginally from last year's allocation as the government seeks to implement an ambitious scheme to provide health insurance for millions of people. Some economists said global trade tensions and the outbreak of coronavirus in China, which has killed more than 250 people so far, pose a new risk to economic recovery by hitting cross-border commerce and supply chains. ""The economic recovery is likely to be slow and shallow despite the recent measures to boost investments,"" said Anagha Deodhar, an economist at ICICI Securities. Indian shares got off to a choppy start in a special trading session on Saturday ahead of the budget. In early trade shares slipped in reaction to an overnight shakeout in global markets on growing concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China.

1291,Eighth US case of new coronavirus confirmed in Massachussetts,"Authorities said on Saturday that the eighth U.S. case of the new coronavirus was detected in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Department of Health said in a press release that a man in his 20s, who recently returned from China and lives in Boston, tested positively. The man, who was not named, had traveled to Wuhan, the city where the virus originated. ""We are grateful that this young man is recovering and sought medical attention immediately,'' said Massachusetts Public Health Commissioner Dr. Monica Bharel. ""Massachusetts has been preparing for a possible case of this new coronavirus, and we were fortunate that astute clinicians took appropriate action quickly."" The case was the first reported in Massachusetts. Health officials said that the risk to those living in the state remained low. The previous U.S. cases were reported in California, Illinois, Washington state and Arizona. The outbreak has spread to more than 20 countries, but the overwhelming majority of cases have occurred in China. President Donald Trump on Friday declared that the new coronavirus was a public health emergency in the U.S. and imposed new travel restrictions between the U.S. and China. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the U.S. will deny entry to foreign nationals who have traveled to China within the past two weeks, aside from the immediate family of U.S. citizens. More than 12,000 cases of the new coronavirus have been reported globally. The death toll reached 259 as of Saturday morning. Massachusetts health officials said that they were working closely with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

1317,Coronavirus updates: Philippines reports death,"The coverage on this live blog has ended — but for up-to-the-minute coverage on the coronavirus, visit the live blog from CNBC's US team. All times below in Beijing time. A plane repatriating 250 French and European nationals from Wuhan, China — the epicenter of the fast-spreading and deadly coronavirus — landed at a military airbase in Istres, France Sunday afternoon local time. Some 65 French citizens will be quarantined in the south of France, French authorities said, while the other passengers will be repatriated to their home countries. Five military aircraft will evacuate Russian nationals from China over the coronavirus, Russian news agency Interfax said Sunday, citing the country's defense ministry. The conditions in Hubei province are ""severe and complicated"" and medical resources are weak at the county level, vice governor Xiao Juhua told a press conference Sunday, according to a Reuters report. Hubei province is home to Wuhan, the center of the deadly coronavirus outbreak and the site of the vast majority of deaths from the illness. Still, the accuracy of testing kits has reportedly improved, according to Wang Wei, director of Hubei's REAL and FAKEnology department, who also spoke at the briefing. The time required to confirm cases with test kits has halved to around two hours, Reuters reported. Iraq is barring entry to all foreigners coming from China, its interior ministry said Sunday. The Middle Eastern country hosts workers from the China National Petroleum Corp, one of its top foreign investors. All-electric car racing series Formula E has dropped plans for a race in the Chinese city of Sanya, the organization said Sunday, citing concerns over the coronavirus outbreak. The event in the southern Chinese resort city, on the coast of Hainan island, was planned for March 21. Formula E said in a statement that it would continue working with its local partners to ""study the viability of potential alternative dates should the situation improve.""  Indonesia is the latest country to announce a temporary suspension of flights to and from China, to go into effect Wednesday, amid a mounting death and infection count from the deadly coronavirus. The southeast Asian country of 264 million will also suspend its policy of issuing visas on arrival to Chinese nationals, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said Sunday. Foreign nationals who have visited China in the last 14 days will also be barred from entry. The vast majority of coronavirus deaths and infections — now at more than 300 and 14,300, respectively — are in Wuhan, China, where the virus first appeared. A group of 59 students from Myanmar are the latest foreign nationals to be evacuated from Wuhan, China, Burmese authorities said Sunday. They will be quarantined for 14 days in a hospital in Myanmar upon return, health officials said. At least three Burmese students are currently remaining in China, two of which had high fevers and are being kept there by Chinese authorities. Myanmar can't test for the virus itself, so is sending samples to neighboring Thailand, where results are expected within a week of testing. Oman and Saudi state airline Saudia announced suspension of flights to China on Sunday amid mounting cases of the coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases in China early Sunday was at least 14,380 with 304 deaths, and one death outside China, announced in the Philippines on Sunday morning. Business has been shut down in more than half of China — 21 provinces that accounted for more than 80% of national GDP last year — in an effort to contain the virus. South Korea has become the latest country to announce a ban on travelers who have visited the province of Hubei, China, the center of the coronavirus outbreak. The ban will come into place on Tuesday, South Korea's Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on Sunday, according to local news agency Yonhap. South Korea confirmed three new cases of the respiratory illness on Sunday, bringing its total confirmed cases to 15. The Indian government confirmed the country's second case of coronavirus. This case involves a patient in Kerala, a southwestern coastal state where India's first case was also reported. The person in the second case has been isolated in a hospital and is in stable condition, the government said in a statement.  New Zealand raised its travel advisory for China to ""Do not travel,"" recommending its citizens to leave the country as soon as possible. It also said it will place temporary entry restrictions for foreigners with recent travel history in China. The restrictions take effect Monday and will be in place for 14 days. The New Zealand government said it will review this position every 48 hours. Citizens, permanent residents and their families may still enter the country, but will be required to self-isolate for 14 days upon returning to New Zealand. ""It is critically important that we both protect New Zealanders from the virus and play our part in the global effort to contain it. I am particularly mindful that we are a gateway to the Pacific, and must factor that into our decision making,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement. A man who tested positive for the new coronavirus died on Saturday in the Philippines. The 44-year-old man was the second confirmed case in the country and the companion of the person in the first confirmed case, a 38-year-old woman, officials said. Both people are from Wuhan, China — the city at the epicenter of a coronavirus outbreak. Officials said the 44-year-old man was admitted to the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on Jan. 25 after experiencing a fever, cough and sore throat. Officials said he developed a severe pneumonia due to viral and bacterial infections before stabilizing in his last few days. The man's condition, however, deteriorated rapidly in his last 24 hours, officials said. ""This is the first reported case outside of China. However, we need to keep in mind that he came from Wuhan, China,"" Dr. Rabi Abeyasinghe, a World Health Organization representative in the Philippines said in a statement on Twitter.  The White House said President Donald Trump discussed the coronavirus outbreak with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a Friday call. They discussed their countries' ""efforts to monitor, contain, and mitigate the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus,"" according to the White House statement. Philippines broadcaster GMA News reported that President Rodrigo Duterte has barred foreign nationals coming from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao. GMA noted that the country had already barred travelers from Hubei province, where the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan, is located. Filipinos and Philippine residents returning from China will be quarantined for 14 days, GMA reported.  Health officials confirmed three new cases of coronavirus in South Korea, bringing the total to 15. Foreigners who have recently been in mainland China have been barred from entering Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Saturday. He said, however, this is a temporary measure that will be reviewed in 14 days. This does not apply to permanent residents or Australian citizens. The government said it will require these groups to self-isolate for 14 days from the time of their departure from mainland China. Airline crews are also exempt, as long as they have been ""using appropriate personal protective equipment."" Morrison also said the Australian government has raised its travel advisory for all of mainland China to Level Four: ""Do not travel."" China's National Health Commission said it confirmed an additional 45 deaths and 2,590 cases through the end of Feb. 1. All of the additional deaths were in Hubei, according to the NHC. It said it has confirmed a total of 14,380 cases and 304 deaths. Chinese health officials confirmed an additional 45 deaths and 1,921 cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Through the end of Feb. 1, Hubei authorities said they confirmed a total of 9,074 cases, 294 deaths and 215 cured people so far in this outbreak. All times below in U.S. eastern standard time. The first person in New York City is under investigation for coronavirus, according to the Department of Health. The individual, who is under 40-years-old, has been hospitalized and is in stable condition after showing symptoms following travel to mainland China. Testing by the CDC to determine whether this is a confirmed case of coronavirus will take at least 36-48 hours, according to health officials. ""An individual with a travel history to China felt unwell and sought help from a medical provider who promptly contacted the Health Department,"" said Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot.3:15 pm: Pentagon will provide housing for those who need to be quarantined The Pentagon approved a request from the Department of Health and Human services to provide housing for 1,000 people who could need to be quarantined after traveling abroad due to the virus, according to a Pentagon spokesperson. As Apple temporarily closes its stores in China, roughly 1 million of Apple's iPhones in China are at risk of shifting out of the March and into the June quarter if the virus outbreak continues into late February, according to a Webush analyst note. However, the firm notes that it would be a less than 3% of Chinese annual iPhone sales at most and would have a negligible impact. A World Health Organization report said the outbreak is still largely centered in the Hubei province in China. About 60.5% of all China cases since the start of the outbreak are from the region, and the remainder are from 33 other provinces, regions and cities, according to the report. The second largest number of cases are from the Zhejiang province. Furthermore, 101 of the 132 cases confirmed outside of China were people who had traveled to China in the 14 days before the onset of the virus.

Correction: This story has been updated to remove a reference to a tweet from the World Health Organization Philippines, which contained erroneous information about the type of infections found in the 44-year-old man who died. This story has also been updated to correct where the plane evacuating French nationals landed."

1552,Hong Kong reports first coronavirus death,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong reported its first coronavirus death and Macau ordered casinos to shut for two weeks as the Chinese territories battled to halt the spread of an epidemic that has claimed more than 420 lives in mainland China. Hong Kong’s first fatality from the newly identified virus was a 39-year-old man who suffered from an underlying illness and had visited China’s Wuhan city - the epicentre of the outbreak - in January, hospital staff said. It was the second coronavirus death outside mainland China after a 44-year-old Chinese man died in the Philippines, fueling calls for authorities in the Asian financial hub to seal off the border with the mainland. Hundreds of medical workers went on strike for a second day calling on embattled leader Carrie Lam to reverse a decision to leave three checkpoints open and instead shut the border completely. “As Carrie Lam refused to close the border, more (deaths) might come ... We are not threatening the government, we just want to prevent the outbreak,” said Cheng, a 26-year-old nurse attending the strike. Holding red and white placards reading “Save HK now”, masked medical workers took to the streets in Kowloon and more were expected to join the strike later on Tuesday, organisers said. The city’s hospital authority said some emergency services had been “severely” affected by the strike. The strikes have added pressure on the city’s beleagured public hospital network which was already struggling to cope with staff shortages. The latest coronavirus epidemic has rekindled memories in Hong Kong of the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that emerged from mainland China and killed nearly 300 people in the city. The former British colony has had 15 confirmed cases of the newly discovered coronavirus, including one that was transmitted locally. The Hong Kong resident who died on Tuesday had been kept in an isolation ward after the coronavirus was confirmed last week. His 72-year-old mother, who contracted the virus locally and had no travel history, was staying at home during the incubation period, authorities said. The United States, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand and Vietnam are among countries that have denied entry to foreign nationals who have recently been in China. But Lam has rejected calls to seal the entire border, saying it would be inappropriate, impractical and discriminatory. On Monday, authorities announced the closure of four more border crossings with mainland China, leaving open the international airport, a bridge connecting the city to Macau and the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai as well as Shenzhen Bay Port. The World Health Organization has declared the latest coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency but says travel restrictions are unnecessary to contain the epidemic. In Macau, Chief Executive Ho Iat Seng said he had asked all casino operations in the world’s biggest gambling hub to halt operations for two weeks. The former Portuguese colony reported 10 cases of the virus and restricted movement in and out of the territory. Residents were told to wear masks when travelling around the city and to stay at home as much as possible. No immediate details were given about when the casino suspension would begin. Macau’s casinos are usually packed with Chinese high-rollers and are the life-blood of the territory’s economy.

1578,WRAPUP 3-Hong Kong records first death from new coronavirus,"more than 420@ (Updates with detail from Macau, Taiwan) * Man dies in Hong Kong, taking global death toll to 427 * China says U.S. should panic less, help more * Thousands stranded on quarantined Japanese cruise ship * U.S. confirms new case of transmission inside United States * Australian evacuees quarantined on remote island HONG KONG/BEIJING, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Hong Kong reported its first death from the newly identified coronavirus on Tuesday, the second outside mainland China from an outbreak that has killed more than 420 people, spread around the world and raised fears for global economic growth. China's currency and stock markets steadied in choppy trade after anxiety over the coronavirus hit the yuan on Monday and erased some $400 billion in market value from Shanghai's benchmark index. Macau, the world's biggest gambling hub, said it had asked all casino operators to suspend operations for two weeks to help curb the spread of the virus. More foreigners were evacuated from China's locked-down central city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and thousands of people were stranded on a Japanese cruise ship after a passenger tested positive for the virus. The Hong Kong fatality brought the total death toll from the virus to 427, including a man who died in the Philippines last week after visiting Wuhan. Chinese authorities said the toll in China rose by a record 64 from the previous day to 425, mostly in Hubei province of which Wuhan is capital. New cases were reported in the United States including a patient in California who was infected through close contact with someone in the same household who had been infected in China. It marked the second instance of person-to-person spread of the virus in the United States after another such case was reported last week in Illinois. ""We expect to see more cases of person-to-person spread,"" said Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The total number of infections in China rose by 3,235 to 20,438, and there were at least 151 cases in 23 other countries and regions. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency and experts say much is still unknown about the pathogen, including its mortality rate and transmission pathways. Such uncertainties are leading some countries to take extreme measures to stem the spread. Australia sent hundreds of evacuees from Wuhan to a remote island in the Indian Ocean , while Japan ordered the quarantine of a cruise ship carrying more than 3,000 people after a Hong Kong man who sailed on it last month tested positive for coronavirus. MEDICAL WORKERS ON STRIKE In Hong Kong, hospital staff said the 39-year-old male victim had a pre-existing chronic illness and had visited Wuhan in January before falling ill. Hundreds of medical workers in the former British colony held a second day of strikes to force the government to completely close the city's borders with mainland China, a day after embattled leader Carrie Lam left three remaining checkpoints open. The Asian financial center has confirmed 15 cases of the coronavirus and its public hospital network is struggling to cope with a deluge of patients and measures to contain the epidemic. Hong Kong was badly hit by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that emerged from China in 2002 and killed almost 800 people around the world. According to WHO figures, SARS killed 299 people in Hong Kong during that outbreak. Chinese data suggest that the new virus, while much more contagious than SARS, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly. In Wuhan, authorities started converting a gymnasium, exhibition center and cultural complex into makeshift hospitals with more than 3,400 beds for patients suffering from mild cases of the infection, the official Changjiang Daily said. The United States said on Friday it would block nearly all foreign visitors who have been to China within the past 14 days, joining Australia, Singapore, New Zealand, Vietnam and others who have imposed similar restrictions. China accused the United States on Monday of scaremongering and said on Tuesday it would welcome its help to fight the outbreak. ""China has noted that the United States has repeatedly expressed its willingness to provide assistance to China, and hopes that the relevant assistance will be provided soon,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement on the ministry's website. The White House said China had accepted its offer to have U.S. experts as part of a WHO mission to study and help combat the virus. Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province, escalated its war of words over the island's exclusion from the WHO, saying ""vile"" China was preventing it from getting timely information about the outbreak. With Wuhan and some other cities in virtual lockdown, travel severely restricted and China facing increasing international isolation, fears of wider economic disruption are growing. Sources from the OPEC oil cartel said producers were considering cutting output by almost a third to support prices. Airlines around the world have stopped flights to parts of China. A suspension by the United Arab Emirates on Monday will affect the Gulf airlines Etihad and Emirates. Some economists predict world economic output will shrink by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points due to China's lockdown. For a graphic comparing coronavirus outbreaks, see https://tmsnrt.rs/2GK6YVK.

1659,China's airlines told not to axe global flights as thousands are cut,"China's civil aviation authority has urged domestic carriers to continue flying international routes as they consider cuts in response to a drop in demand due to the coronavirus outbreak, state news agency Xinhua reported on Tuesday. Airline capacity is being axed in the world's second-largest aviation market with ""the most dramatic change in schedules"", OAG Aviation Worldwide Ltd said, adding that more than 25,000 flights to, from or within China will be canceled this week. The coronavirus epidemic, which has killed more than 400 people in China, has resulted in bans or restrictions on travel to and from China imposed by countries including Singapore and Italy. The World Health Organization's director-FAKE, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had said travel bans were unnecessary. The Civil Aviation Administration of China's appeal to the country's airlines was reported on Xinhua's account on Chinese messaging app Weibo. Data from aviation statistics provider VariFlight showed 41 Chinese carriers canceled nearly two-thirds of the 16,623 planned flights for Tuesday as of 10:30 a.m. Beijing time (0230 GMT). In addition, 10 regional airlines from Hong Kong and Taiwan had canceled 162 flights, while 37 airlines from other countries canceled 168 flights on the same day, VariFlight said. It also said that some 90,000 flights were canceled between Jan. 10 and Feb. 3, and that about 10,000 planned flights on average have been scrapped each day since the start of February. The coronavirus outbreak has stopped millions of Chinese people from traveling, with the number of trips over this year's Lunar New Year break down 30% to 1.3 billion compared to last year, Ministry of Transportation data showed. Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific plans to cut around 30% of its capacity over the next two months, including around 90% of its flights to mainland China, as it grapples with the epidemic, its CEO said on Tuesday."

1812,European stocks turn higher,"European stocks closed higher on Wednesday, extending gains from earlier in the week despite the coronavirus outbreak. The pan-European Stoxx 600 reversed early losses to close provisionally over 1% higher, with auto shares leading the gains while only telecoms traded in the red. Reuters said a Chinese TV media outlet had reported that a research team at Zhejiang University had found an effective drug to treat people with the new coronavirus. The news agency, citing traders, suggested this was a reason for the move higher in stocks. Investors have been trying to weigh the economic impact of the outbreak, and the World Health Organization said that cases surged to 24,363 over the last 24 hours, ""the most cases in a single day since the outbreak started."" On Wall Street, stocks followed the positive momentum overseas, with all the major U.S. indexes in the green. The Nasdaq, however, pared gains slightly as Tesla shares plummeted following a monster rally. In other news, oil prices rose on Wednesday, boosted by OPEC and non-OPEC producers including Russia (an alliance collectively known as OPEC+) discussing potential further output cuts to counteract a potential drop in global oil demand amid the coronavirus outbreak. The OPEC+ committee met again Wednesday. On the data front, final purchasing managers' index (PMI) readings showed that euro zone REAL activity made a solid start to 2020, beating preliminary estimates to rise to a five-month high of 51.3 in January from December's 50.9. Germany led the positive surprises, its service sector growing at its strongest pace in five months to rise to 54.2 from 52.9 in December. Danske Bank, BNP Paribas, Siemens, Infineon, Novonordisk, ABB and Vodafone all reported earnings on Wednesday. BNP Paribas posted a slightly better-than-expected fourth-quarter net profit of 1.84 billion euros ($2 billion) but cut its profitability outlook, sending the French lender's shares nearly 1% higher. Danske Bank posted flat net profits for 2019 and warned that its 2020 profit could almost halve amid pressure from a 200 billion euro money-laundering scandal and negative interest rates. Danske Bank shares initially fell, before trading 0.5% higher. Infineon surged 11% after meeting profit expectations and confirming its forward guidance. Siemens reported a 3% fall in net profit in its fiscal first quarter, weighed down by weakness in the auto and energy sectors, but saw its shares edge 0.6% higher. The German conglomerate announced plans to buy Iberdrola's stake in Spanish wind turbine maker Siemens Gamesa, which in turn took its shares almost 6% higher. Valmet Corp was the biggest climber in the Stoxx 600 on Wednesday, adding nearly 15% after the Finnish FAKE company increased its financial targets on the back of a strong fourth quarter. GN Store Nord gained almost 9% after the Danish hearing aid manufacturer reported strong fourth-quarter earnings. At the other end of the European benchmark, Imperial Brands tumbled 7% after issuing a profit warning in its first-quarter trading update.﻿"

1870,Toyota Motor (TM) earnings,"Toyota Motor nudged up its annual operating profit forecast by 4.2% on favorable currency rates and better-than-expected sales, but added the impact of the new coronavirus was hard to gauge and had not yet been factored in. Automakers have suspended output at many factories in China in line with government guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus which has led to some 560 deaths in the country. The epidemic is likely to wreak havoc on China auto sales and production in the first quarter, and has disrupted the supply of parts for some carmakers with Hyundai Motor this week saying it would have to suspend production in South Korea. ""We are looking very closely at inventories of components which are made in China and used in other countries, including Japan, and at the possibility of alternative production,"" Operating Officer Masayoshi Shirayanagi told a news conference. S&P credit analyst Vittoria Ferraris has estimated ""up to one-half"" of vehicles and components that would normally be produced in China could be affected if shutdowns are extended further. Production at many plants across China, including Toyota's, has currently been halted through to Feb. 9. Toyota has said it plans to resume production on Feb. 10 although this could change if the situation worsens. Japan's biggest automaker said it now expects operating profit for the year to end-March to climb to 2.5 trillion yen ($22.7 billion), up from 2.47 trillion yen a year earlier and in line with market estimates. The outlook is based on a new assumption for the Japanese currency to average around 108 yen to the U.S. dollar during the current REAL year versus 107 yen previously. It also expects to sell 10.73 million vehicles, slightly higher than a previous forecast for 10.7 million. Third-quarter profit, however, declined 3.2% to 654.4 billion yen as the yen trended higher than expected during the period and due to softer vehicle sales, though the result was slightly higher than market expectations. Sales in Asia tumbled 12.5% with demand slow in Indonesia and Thailand, while sales in North America, Toyota's biggest market, slipped 1.8%. Toyota also said it was seeking more discussion with the British government, which announced plans this week to ban the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars in the country from 2035. That is five years ahead of many other countries with similar targets in what has been seen as a victory for battery-electric cars. ""We don't believe it's possible to suddenly say 'OK, let's move to something like this and ban everything in one shot'. We should have steps to do this kind of thing,"" Executive Vice President Didier Leroy said. ""It's going to create big trouble for all carmakers in the world and even for customers in the UK."" Toyota operates a plant in Derbyshire, central England and produced roughly 8% of the 1.52 million cars made in Britain in 2018. It also produces engines at a factory in Wales."

1907,WRAPUP 13-Chinese doctor who raised early alarm over coronavirus dies,"Beijing declares 'people's war'@ * Chinese cities cut off, factories shut, flights cancelled * Asian trade fairs and industry conferences postponed * People turning to HIV drugs in desperation SHANGHAI/BEIJING, Feb 6 (Reuters) - One of the first Chinese doctors who tried to warn the world about a new coronavirus died on Friday from the illness, as Beijing declared a ""people's war"" on the fast-spreading outbreak. Li Wenliang, 34, was an ophthalmologist at a hospital in Wuhan, the city hardest hit by the outbreak. He and seven others were reprimanded by Wuhan police last month for spreading ""illegal and false"" information about the coronavirus. Li had told a group of doctors on Chinese social media about seven cases he saw and posted a picture of a test result in an effort to help other doctors. As the death toll in mainland China jumped by 73 to 563, with more than 28,000 infections, President Xi Jinping sought to reassure his citizens and the world that China would beat the coronavirus. ""The whole country has responded with all its strength to respond with the most thorough and strict prevention and control measures, starting a people's war for epidemic prevention and control,"" Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying in a telephone call with Saudi Arabia's King Salman. In a striking image of the epidemic's reach, about 3,700 people moored off Japan on the Diamond Princess faced testing and quarantine for at least two weeks on the ship, which has 20 cases. In Hong Kong, another cruise ship with 3,600 passengers and crew was quarantined for a second day pending testing with three cases on board. Taiwan, which has 13 cases, banned international cruise ships from docking. In China, sometimes dubbed the world's workshop, cities have been shut off, flights cancelled and factories closed, cutting off supply lines crucial to international REALes. CORPORATE FALLOUT Companies including Hyundai Motor Co, Tesla Inc , Ford Motor Co, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Airbus, Adidas and Foxconn are taking hits. Financial analysts have cut China's growth outlook, with ratings agency Moody's flagging risks for auto sales and output. Nintendo Co Ltd warned of delays to production and shipping of its Switch console and other goods to the Japan market. Honda Motor Co was considering keeping operations suspended for longer than planned at its three plants in Wuhan, Japan's Nikkei newspaper reported. Indonesia said it stands to lose $4 billion in tourism if travel from China is disrupted for the whole year. More than two dozen large trade fairs and industry conferences in Asia, where billions of dollars worth of deals are usually done, have been postponed. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, hit by months of anti-China unrest, said the coronavirus was hurting its economy and urged banks to adopt a ""sympathetic stance"" with borrowers. But U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he still expected China to maintain its commitment to boost purchases of American goods and services by at least $200 billion over the next two years, as part of a Phase 1 trade deal. And stock markets across the world rose, buoyed by record highs on Wall Street and a move by China to halve tariffs on some U.S. goods that emboldened bets the global economy would avoid long-term damage from the virus. China, which has bristled at being ostracised, was considering delaying an annual meeting of its highest legislative body, the National People's Congress, from March 5, sources said. RUSH FOR HIV DRUG The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was too early to say the outbreak was peaking, but noted the country had recorded its first day of a drop in the number of new infections. ""We are still in the middle of an intense outbreak,"" said WHO emergencies expert Mike Ryan, calling it ""a great worry."" WHO epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove, said the virus causes a full spectrum of disease, from what looks like the common cold to pneumonia including multiple organ failure and death. One Chinese official said the crisis could be nearing its peak, with just over 1,300 patients discharged from hospital, although the number of new patients diagnosed with coronavirus was still rising. ""The darkest time is before the dawn,"" the official said. ""I have full confidence that we're going to get ahead of it."" ""The biggest challenge is still to control the spread of the disease, and let all the suspected patients be cured in the hospital."" Devy, a 38-year-old from Shandong province, said he was among hundreds who had asked people with HIV for antiviral medicine. ""When you are left alone, seeing the blur shadow of death far away, I think no one can feel calm,"" Devy told Reuters. People were also desperate for face masks. The city of Dali, in southwestern Yunnan province, with only eight confirmed cases of the virus, was accused of intercepting a shipment of masks bound for a municipality with 400 cases. In the overwhelmed province of Hubei, of which Wuhan is the capital, authorities said they needed another 2,250 medical staff at least. Around a nation unaccustomed to widespread working from home, the epidemic has forced millions of white-collar workers to get used to just that.

1911,Asia Rice-India rates hit 4-month high,"* Thai rice prices fall due to a weak baht, coronavirus * Deliveries of Vietnamese farm produce hurt by virus-trader * Bangladesh offers traders cash subsidy worth 15% of rice exports * India's 2019 rice exports slide to 8-year low - govt data BENGALURU, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Rice export prices in India edged up to the highest level in more than four months this week, helped by healthy demand from African countries, while markets in Thailand and Vietnam grapple with the new coronavirus outbreak. India's 5 percent broken parboiled variety <RI-INBKN5-P1> was quoted around $370-$375 per tonne this week, the highest since the last week of September. Export prices were up from $369-$373 quoted in the previous week, also supported by an appreciation in rupee. ""Demand is good for the new season crop. Prices are also competitive,"" said an exporter based at Kakinada in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. The uptick in demand came after rice exports in 2019 fell 18.1% from a year ago to their lowest in eight years, government data showed. Thailand's benchmark 5 percent broken rice <RI-THBKN5-P1> prices eased to $425-$439 a tonne from $432-$453 last week, hurt by a weak local currency. The Thai baht plunged to a seven-month low on Jan. 30, weighed down by the spread of the coronavirus that threatened the country's tourism sector, a key driver of growth. Traders expect export prices to drop further on the outbreak that has killed 563 people in mainland China. China was Thailand's second-largest export market last year. Chinese tourists also account for more than a quarter of total tourist arrivals in the Southeast Asian country each year. Domestic rice prices in Thailand remained high as a persistent drought undermined new supply, according to a Bangkok-based trader. ""The ongoing coronavirus epidemic in China has also caused disruption to deliveries of Vietnamese farm produce to China, including rice,"" a trader based in Ho Chi Minh City said. The impact on shipments was however limited since China had been cutting down on rice imports from Vietnam for over a year, the trader said. Rates for 5% broken rice <RI-VNBKN5-P1> in Vietnam rose to $355-$360 per tonne from $345 a tonne a week ago. ""Demand for 5% broken rice remains strong but the growing area in Vietnam is shrinking, partly due to salinity,"" the trader said. Farmers in the Mekong Delta have harvested around 30% of the winter-spring crop, traders said. Meanwhile, Bangladesh has offered traders a cash subsidy worth 15% of rice exports in a bid to compete with rivals and protect farmers struggling with low prices, Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzak said on Wednesday. ""We wanted at least a 20% cash subsidy. It'll still be difficult to fight our competitors,"" a trader told Reuters.

1927,WRAPUP 6-More virus cases on cruise ship off Japan,"500@ (Adds WHO supplies, Shanghai official, quote on delay; paragraphs 18,23,31) * Death toll in mainland China rises by 73 to 563 * Ten more cases reported on cruise ship off Japan * Several cases linked to company meeting in Singapore * Hundreds of experts to gather in Geneva to combat virus * China weighs delay to annual meet of top legislative body SHANGHAI/BEIJING, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Ten more people on a quarantined cruise liner in Japan have tested positive for coronavirus, officials said on Thursday, as health experts stepped up efforts to find a vaccine for a disease that has provoked fears of a global pandemic. The death toll from the virus in mainland China jumped by 73 to 563, with more than 28,000 confirmed infections there. Financial analysts have cut their growth outlook for the world's second-largest economy, with ratings agency Moodys pointing to a risk to auto sales and production. But global stocks extended their recovery, cheered by record closes in Wall Street benchmarks following encouraging economic data and China's announcement of a tariff cut on some imports from the United States, which analysts saw as a move to boost confidence. The virus has shut down cities and factories in China and disrupted global air travel. This week, it brought chaos to the sedate world of luxury ocean cruises. About 3,700 people on Carnival's Diamond Princess, docked off a Japanese port, face quarantine for at least two weeks on the ship, which has 20 virus cases, with testing continuing. Japan now has 45 virus cases. Gay Courter, a 75-year-old American novelist on the ship, said he hoped the U.S. government would send transport to take the Americans off. ""Its better for us to travel while healthy and also if we get sick to be treated in American hospitals,"" he told Reuters. In Hong Kong, a cruise ship with 3,600 passengers and crew was quarantined for a second day pending testing after three positive cases on board. Taiwan, which has 13 cases, banned international cruise ships from docking. TROUBLING TRANSMISSION Several countries, including the United States, have banned entry to visitors who have been in China over the previous two weeks. News of another virus hot spot emerged, linked to a mid-January company meeting in Singapore. At least three people caught the disease after a conference held with 94 overseas staff, including one from China's central city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic. Authorities have not identified the company, but the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was investigating. Singapore has reported 28 infections, some involving person-to-person transmission, a feature the WHO has said is deeply concerning and could signal a much larger outbreak. Health officials in the United States and China have set ambitious goals for getting a vaccine to initial human testing within the next few months, although drugmakers cautioned that they have a long way to go. ""There are no known effective therapeutics,"" WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said, when asked about reports of drug ""breakthroughs"" that boosted hopes on financial markets on Wednesday. Hundreds of experts will gather in Geneva on Feb. 11-12 to try and find a way to battle the outbreak by speeding research into drugs and vaccines, the WHO said, adding that a multinational WHO-led team would also visit China. The WHO is also sending emergency supplies, including 500,000 mask and 250,000 testing kits, to dozens of countries. Most of those infected recover quickly with only mild symptoms but the virus can lead to severe respiratory illnesses. It is too early to know how lethal it may be, as many mild cases are probably going undetected. NO END IN SIGHT Tens of millions of people in China's central province of Hubei, the capital of which is Wuhan, have been living under virtual lockdown for nearly two weeks, with train stations and airports shut, roads sealed off, and no end in sight. Hubei reported 70 new deaths on Wednesday and 2,987 new confirmed cases, for more than 80% of China's total. Other deaths were in Tianjin city, the northeastern province of Heilongjiang and Guizhou province in the southwest. National health officials said 3,694 coronavirus cases were reported throughout China on Wednesday, the first day in more than a week to see a fall in new daily cases. They did not say why. At a briefing in Shanghai, a mental health official, asked how people could avoid stress over the outbreak, said they should not watch too much news about it but enjoy television soap operas instead: ""That could help people relieve their anxiety,"" said the official, Xie Bin. First identified in Wuhan, the flu-like virus is believed to have originated at a city market selling wild animals. The two deaths outside mainland China, in the Philippines and Hong Kong, have both involved visits to Wuhan, where more than 400 people have died. Nearly 260 cases have been reported in 31 countries and regions outside mainland China, according to a Reuters tally based on authorities' figures. More than two dozen airlines have suspended or restricted flights to China and hundreds of foreigners have been evacuated from Wuhan and placed in quarantine around the world. China, which has bristled at some measures to close borders to its travellers, was considering delaying an annual meeting of its top legislative body set to begin on March 5, people familiar with the matter said. ""The situation doesn't look likely to be contained by March,"" a senior government official told Reuters.

The virus outbreak in China has sapped risk appetite around the world recently but stimulus and containment measures from China were well-received by investors, even as the death toll from the fast-spreading virus in mainland China jumped to 563 as of Thursday. MSCI's index for Latin American stocks gained more than 1%, while the index for currencies rose 0.4%. Brazil's real rallied in early trading before falling flat against the greenback, as the central bank signaled the night before that its latest interest rate cut will bring its easing cycle to an end. Brazil's central bank on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a record-low 4.25%, marking its fifth consecutive cut. In Argentina, its senate voted in favor of a bill on Wednesday that grants power to the government of President Alberto Fernandez to handle a massive debt restructuring of bonds issued in foreign currencies. Its peso currency weakened against the dollar on Thursday. The South American nation is grappling with about $100 billion in sovereign debt it is seeking to restructure with its creditors, including the International Monetary Fund, which has a $57 billion financing package with the country. Other currencies in the region - the Mexican peso, Chilean peso, Colombian peso and Peruvian sol - traded in tight ranges.

2023,UPDATE 4-Twenty virus infections on cruise ship in Japan,"(Adds quotes, colour from passengers) By David Dolan and Elaine Lies TOKYO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Ten more people on a quarantined cruise liner in a Japanese port have tested positive for coronavirus, officials said on Thursday, taking the number of infected passengers to 20 with test results on more than 170 still pending. About 3,700 people are facing at least two weeks quarantine on the Diamond Princess ship in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, after 10 people were initially confirmed with the virus and moved to medical facilities. The total number of coronavirus patients in Japan is now 45. Test results on around 171 people from the cruise ship are still pending. The 10 new cases included four Japanese, two Americans, two Canadians, one person from New Zealand and one from Taiwan. Carnival’s Diamond Princess was caught up in the global coronavirus epidemic after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man tested positive for the virus after disembarking late last month. The ship arrived in Yokohama on Monday after a 14-day round trip. Clyde and Renee Smith, a U.S. couple who are both 80 and on the cruise with two adult grandsons, said they were on a bus trip with the man in Kagoshima, southern Japan, but both tested negative for the virus. They were enduring their second day in a stateroom that, as Renee told Reuters by phone from the ship, “is tiny, we don’t have a window, there are four of us - and only one chair.” They’ve spent time reading and watching movies, including “Crazy Rich Asians” and “Aquaman.” Grandson Sawyer Smith, 25, a workout devotee, does crunches since he can’t visit the gym. “It’s not really to the point where we’re getting stir-crazy, if they keep us in the rooms for four to five days it might be a little different,” Sawyer said. Others, though, were starting to feel confined. One 43-year-old Hong Kong resident, also in a windowless room, said they had received food, toilet paper and games and art supplies for their child. But it was sunlight they wanted, he said. “Wondering though when we can step outside the room, if at all, for sunlight,” the man, who declined to be named, told Reuters, adding he hadn’t been in direct sunlight since Tuesday. “I got a peek of it when the opposite room opened their door to receive breakfast, as that room has a balcony. The sky looked blue.” Other passengers said food delivery to the rooms was slow. “Of course, our greatest worry is that we have been infected,” said Gay Courter, a 75-year-old U.S. novelist. “We are hopeful that the U.S. government will be sending transport for the Americans on board it’s better for us to travel while healthy and also if we get sick to be treated in American hospitals.” Concern has also spread to ports the ship visited along the way, including Naha on Japan’s tropical Okinawa island and Taipei in Taiwan, where passengers went on day trips. A health official in Naha said they were trying to trace the path of the infected passengers, while Taipei’s National Palace Museum disinfected its exhibition rooms and Taiwan banned all cruise ships from making port. Japan is making arrangements to send a fourth chartered plane to Wuhan to pick up around 200 people on Thursday night, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. These are likely to include Chinese spouses as well as Japanese. The virus death toll in mainland China hit 563 on Thursday, with almost 3,000 new cases reported. China’s National Health Commission said another 3,694 coronavirus cases were reported throughout the country on Feb. 5, bringing the total to 28,018. Nearly 260 cases have been reported in 31 other countries and regions outside mainland China, according to a Reuters tally based on official statements from the authorities involved.

2059,WRAPUP 12-Cruise line bans China citizens,"alarm over virus dies@ (Adds Royal Caribbean announcement, Pompeo, WHO comments) * Doctor was reprimanded by police after raising alarm * U.S. sends 18 tons of donated medical supplies * WHO warns against racial stigma over virus BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Feb 7 (Reuters) - The coronavirus death of a Chinese doctor who had been reprimanded for sounding an early warning about the disease triggered anger at the government on Friday, while a major cruise line took the extraordinary step of banning citizens of China regardless of when they were last there. The death of Li Wenliang, 34, came as President Xi Jinping reassured the United States and the World Health Organization (WHO) of transparency and maximum effort to combat the virus. Beijing's communist leadership has sealed off cities, cancelled flights and closed factories to limit an epidemic roiling the world's second-biggest economy with ripple effects felt by global markets and REALes dependent on Chinese supply lines. The epicentre province of Hubei and its capital Wuhan are in lockdown, and Beijing resembles a ghost town. Deaths in mainland China reached 637 on Friday, with a total of 31,211 cases, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva, warning of a worldwide shortage of gowns, masks and other protective equipment. ""For the last two days there had been fewer reported infections in China, which is good news, but we caution against reading too much into that,"" he told the WHO Executive Board. ""The numbers could go up again."" Global equity markets and government debt yields slumped on Friday, as growing concerns about the impact of the virus on global growth overshadowed a strong U.S. jobs report. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday said the State Department ""has facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators and other vital materials."" OPHTHALMOLOGIST REBUKED Ophthalmologist Li was among eight people reprimanded by police in the city of Wuhan, which has suffered the brunt of the outbreak since the virus emerged there, for spreading ""illegal and false"" information. Li was made to sign a letter on Jan. 3, saying he had ""severely disrupted social order"" and was threatened with charges. Social media users called him a hero and shared a selfie of him lying on a hospital bed wearing an oxygen respirator and holding up his Chinese identification card. One image showed the message ""farewell Li Wenliang"" etched into snow on a riverbank. ""Wuhan indeed owes Li Wenliang an apology,"" said Hu Xilinx, editor of the government-backed Global Times tabloid. Rights group Amnesty International called his death a ""tragic reminder"" of how China's preoccupation with stability made it suppress vital information. China had been accused of trying to cover up the 2003 SARS outbreak that killed almost 800 people worldwide. There were signs that discussion of Li's death was being censored. After briefly trending on Weibo, the topics ""the Wuhan government owes doctor Li Wenliang an apology"" and ""we want free speech"" yielded no search results. ""UNACCEPTABLE STIGMA"" The virus has spread around the world, with 320 cases now in 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, a Reuters tally of official statements showed. WHO emergency expert Mike Ryan called out a stigma being attached to the virus over reports of Asians being shunned in the West. ""The unnecessary, unhelpful profiling of individuals based on ethnicity is utterly and completely unacceptable and it needs to stop,"" he said. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd issued a statement on Friday saying: ""Any guest or crewmen travelling from, to, or through mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau less than 15 days prior to their sailing will be unable to board any of our ships."" But it did not stop there. It also said, ""Any guests holding a Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passport, regardless of when they were there last, will not be allowed to board our ships."" China has complained bitterly about bans and measures that go against WHO recommendations and accused governments and companies that take such actions of fear mongering. Two deaths have been reported outside mainland China, in Hong Kong and the Philippines, but how deadly and contagious the virus is remains unclear, prompting countries to quarantine hundreds of people and cut travel links with China. About two dozen sick passengers aboard a Royal Caribbean ship that arrived off New Jersey in the United States were screened for the coronavirus, with four sent to a local hospital out of ""an abundance of caution,"" the local mayor said. There were 41 new cases among about 3,700 people quarantined in a cruise ship off Japan, taking the total to 61, while Chinese-ruled Hong Kong quarantined for a third day a cruise ship with 3,600 on board. ""A cruise ship is a very particular environment in which you can have higher levels of transmission even with a virus that isn't very efficient at transmission,"" WHO's Ryan told a news conference in Geneva. The outbreak could have spread from bats to humans via illegal traffic of pangolins, the world's only scaly mammals, Chinese researchers said, sparking some scepticism. The head of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice, Li Fuying, told reporters that people deliberately concealing contacts or refusing isolation could be punished with death.

2108,WRAPUP 5-Mild weather boosts U.S. job growth,"(Adds Trump and Pelosi remarks, analyst comments, updates markets) * Nonfarm payrolls increase 225,000 in January * Unemployment rate rises to 3.6% * Average hourly earnings gain 0.2% * Annual revisions slash job growth from April 2018-March 2019 WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - U.S. job growth accelerated in January, with unseasonably mild temperatures boosting hiring in weather-sensitive sectors, indicating the economy will probably continue to grow moderately despite a deepening slump in REAL investment. The Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday, however, showed the economy created 514,000 fewer jobs between April 2018 and March 2019 than originally estimated. The strong start to 2020 is a boost to President Donald Trump who is seeking a second term in office in the Nov. 3 election, but the biggest downgrade to payrolls over a 12-month period since 2009 showed the labor market was not as robust as the Republican president has boasted. ""Strong job creation in January provided reassurance that the record-long economic expansion still has room to run,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""But this latest health report also points to a maturing labor market, with benchmark revisions showing it isn't as youthful as it has pretended to be over the last two years."" Nonfarm payrolls increased by 225,000 jobs last month, with employment at construction sites increasing by the most in a year amid milder-than-normal temperatures, the government's survey of establishments showed. There were also strong gains in hiring in the transportation and warehousing industry. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would rise by 160,000 jobs in January. Some said the unusually warm weather was likely throwing off the model the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data, juicing the numbers. With the coronavirus hitting the Chinese economy hard, U.S. payrolls growth could slow in the coming months. The Federal Reserve on Friday flagged the coronavirus as a risk to the U.S. economy. ""Until it is clear that the hiring was due to an upward shift in the overall economic growth rate, we have to assume that there are weaker numbers coming sometime during the next few months,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. The economy grew 2.3% in 2019, the slowest performance in three years, after logging 2.9% growth in 2018. Growth this year is seen around 2%. The benchmark revisions left job gains in 2019 at 2.1 million, the fewest since 2011. Trump, speaking ahead of a trip to North Carolina, described the job numbers as ""fantastic"" and added that ""jobs continue to be great, our country continues to do great."" U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said the sharp downgrade to payrolls in the 12 months through last March ""shows the rot at the heart of the Trump economy."" She noted that ""three years in, the Trump economy is creating 42,000 fewer jobs a month on average than the last three years of President Obama."" UNEMPLOYMENT RATE RISES Economists said the size of the benchmark revisions, which showed substantial downgrades to manufacturing employment from August through December 2018, suggested the government might not be fully capturing the impact on payrolls of Trump's 19-month trade war with China, which has contributed to the longest downturn in REAL investment since 2009. ""Tariffs hit activity and employment in a way that the BLS did not incorporate at the time,"" said Samuel Coffin, an economist at UBS in Stamford Connecticut. ""We believe the same is happening now."" Stocks on Wall Street retreated from record highs as investors focused on the benchmark revisions. The dollar traded higher against a basket of currencies while prices of U.S. Treasuries rose. Economists said the report supported the Fed's desire to keep interest rates unchanged this year. The government also introduced updated population estimates to its smaller household survey data. The unemployment rate is calculated from the household survey. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, rose two-tenths of a percentage point to 63.4% last month, the highest since June 2013. As a result, the jobless rate rose to 3.6% from 3.5% in December. Economists said the higher participation rate, if sustained, suggests the economy needs to create about 130,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population, instead of the  100,000 estimated by Fed officials. ""Despite the downward pressure from an aging workforce, the participation rate has edged higher over the past few years amid a vigorous rebound in prime-age, especially women's prime-age, participation,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. With slack still remaining in the labor market, wage inflation remains tame. Average hourly earnings increased 0.2%, last month after gaining 0.1% in December. That lifted the annual increase in wages to 3.1% in January from 3.0% in December. The average workweek was 34.3 hours for a third straight month in January. The construction industry added 44,000 jobs in January, the largest since January 2019, after payrolls increased by 11,000 in December. Employment in the transportation and warehousing industry accelerated by 28,000, driven by gains in the hiring of couriers and messengers. Payrolls in the leisure and hospitality sector increased by 36,000 jobs. Healthcare and social assistance employment rose by 47,200 jobs. There were also gains in hiring in the professional and REAL services, and wholesale trade industries. But manufacturing employment declined by 12,000 jobs after falling by 5,000 in December. The industry has been the hardest hit by the U.S.-China trade war. Though Washington and Beijing signed a Phase 1 trade deal last month, U.S. tariffs on $360 billion of Chinese imports, about two-thirds of the total, remained in place. Manufacturing is also being squeezed by Boeing's suspension last month of production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner. Boeing's biggest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc, said last month it planned to lay off more than 20% of the workforce at its facility in Wichita, Kansas because of the 737 MAX production suspension. The mining and logging industry added no jobs last month, while retail payrolls dropped 8,300. Further job losses are likely as Macy's announced layoffs and closures this week. Government payrolls rose by 19,000 jobs in January, with some hiring for the 2020 decennial census. (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)"

2126,WRAPUP 13-Cruise line bans China citizens,"coronavirus alarm dies@ * Doctor who died had been reprimanded by police * U.S. sends 18 tons of donated medical supplies * WHO warns against racial stigma over virus BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Feb 7 (Reuters) - A major cruise line on Friday took the extraordinary step of banning citizens of China regardless of when they were last there, while there was sorrow and anger over the coronavirus death of a doctor from Wuhan who had been reprimanded for sounding an early warning about the disease. The death of Li Wenliang, 34, came as President Xi Jinping reassured the United States and the World Health Organization (WHO) of transparency and maximum effort to combat the virus. Beijing's communist leadership has sealed off cities, cancelled flights and closed factories to limit an epidemic roiling the world's second-biggest economy, with ripple effects felt by global markets and REALes dependent on Chinese supply lines. The epicentre province of Hubei and its capital Wuhan are in lockdown, and Beijing resembles a ghost town. Apple Inc, however, said it was working to reopen its China corporate offices and call centres next week, and was making preparations to reopen retail stores there. After two days in which Hubei reported fewer new cases of coronavirus and deaths, spurring some optimism, there was an uptick on Friday. The Hubei health commission website reported 82 new deaths and 2,841 new cases in the province, taking the mainland China totals to more than 700 deaths and over 34,000 infections WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, speaking in Geneva, had cautioned earlier that ""the numbers could go up again,"" and warned of worldwide shortages of gowns, masks and other protective equipment. Global equity markets and government debt yields slumped on Friday, as growing concerns about the virus' impact on global growth overshadowed a strong U.S. jobs report. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday said the United States was prepared to spend up to $100 million to assist China and support coronavirus efforts by the WHO. The United States has sent nearly 17.8 tons of medical supplies to China, including masks, gowns and respirators, a State Department official said. The WHO said out of $675 million it is seeking for its coronavirus response through April, it has received pledges of $110 million, $100 million of that from the Gates Foundation. 'A TRAGIC REMINDER' Ophthalmologist Li was among eight people reprimanded by police in Wuhan, which has suffered the brunt of the outbreak since the virus emerged there, for spreading ""illegal and false"" information. Li was made to sign a letter saying he had ""severely disrupted social order"" and was threatened with charges. Social media users called him a hero and shared a selfie of him lying on a hospital bed wearing an oxygen respirator and holding up his Chinese identification card. One image showed the message ""farewell Li Wenliang"" etched into snow on a riverbank. ""Wuhan indeed owes Li Wenliang an apology,"" said Hu Xilinx, editor of the government-backed Global Times tabloid. Rights group Amnesty International called his death a ""tragic reminder"" of how China's preoccupation with stability made it suppress vital information. China had been accused of trying to cover up the 2003 SARS outbreak that killed almost 800 people worldwide. There were signs that discussion of Li's death was being censored. After briefly trending on Weibo, the topics ""the Wuhan government owes doctor Li Wenliang an apology"" and ""we want free speech"" yielded no search results. CHINA CITIZENS BANNED The virus has spread around the world, with 320 cases now in 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, a Reuters tally of official statements showed. WHO emergency expert Mike Ryan said reports of Asians being shunned in the West over a perceived connection to coronavirus was ""utterly and completely unacceptable and it needs to stop."" Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd issued a statement on Friday saying: ""Any guest or crewmen traveling from, to, or through mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau less than 15 days prior to their sailing will be unable to board any of our ships."" But it did not stop there. It also said, ""Any guests holding a Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passport, regardless of when they were there last, will not be allowed to board our ships."" China has complained bitterly about bans and measures that go against WHO recommendations and accused governments and companies that take such actions of fear mongering. Two deaths have been reported outside mainland China, in Hong Kong and the Philippines, but how deadly and contagious the virus is remains unclear, prompting countries to quarantine hundreds of people and cut travel links with China. Four sick passengers aboard a Royal Caribbean ship that arrived off New Jersey in the United States were sent to a hospital out of ""an abundance of caution,"" the local mayor said. There were 41 new cases among about 3,700 people quarantined in a cruise ship off Japan, taking the total to 61, while Chinese-ruled Hong Kong quarantined for a third day a cruise ship with 3,600 on board. ""A cruise ship is a very particular environment in which you can have higher levels of transmission even with a virus that isn't very efficient at transmission,"" WHO's Ryan told a news conference in Geneva. The head of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice, Li Fuying, told reporters that people deliberately concealing contacts or refusing isolation could be punished with death.

2135,WRAPUP 5-China doctor who warned of coronavirus mourned,"(Updates with detail on financial markets) * Doctor Li Wenliang dies in Wuhan hospital * Li was reprimanded by police after raising alarm * Chinese president assured Trump virus will be defeated * Death toll rises by 73 to 636 * Asian markets fall on virus BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Feb 7 (Reuters) - A Chinese doctor who issued an early warning about the coronavirus outbreak before it was officially recognised died of the virus on Friday, triggering a wave of public mourning and rare expressions of anger towards the government online. The death of the doctor who sounded the alarm, ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, came as Chinese President Xi Jinping assured his U.S. counterpart that China was doing all it could to contain the virus that has killed almost 640 people. China was gradually achieving results and was confident it could defeat the epidemic with no long-term consequences for economic development, Xi told President Donald Trump in a telephone call, according to state television. China's central bank vowed further support for the world's second-biggest economy, with the outbreak expected to knock 2 percentage points, or more, off its first-quarter growth, from 6%, analysts say. Chinese stocks had their worst week since May, while elsewhere in Asia, financial markets slipped after several days of gains. The death of Li, 34, spurred an outpouring of grief on social media. He was one of eight people reprimanded by police in the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the flu-like contagion in central Hubei province, for spreading ""illegal and false"" information about it. Li's social media messages warning of a new ""SARS-like"" coronavirus - a reference to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which originated in China and killed almost 800 people around the world in 2002-2003 - triggered the wrath of police. China was accused of trying to cover up SARS. ""Wuhan indeed owes Li Wenliang an apology,"" Hu Xijin, editor of the government-backed Global Times tabloid, said on social media. ""Wuhan and Hubei officials also owe a solemn apology to the people of Hubei and this country."" Li was forced to sign a letter on Jan. 3, saying he had ""severely disrupted social order"" and was threatened with charges. ""We deeply mourn the death of Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang ... After all-effort rescue, Li passed away on 2:58 a.m.,"" the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily said on Twitter. Social media users called Li a hero, accusing authorities of incompetence in the early stages of the outbreak. ""Light a candle and pay tribute,"" one person posted on the Weibo platform. Zhan Jiang, a professor of international journalism and communication at Beijing Foreign Studies University, called on his Weibo account for a law to shield people like Li. It would ""protect people who have the inborn sense of right and wrong in telling faithful words to the public, and reveal the truth"", he said in his post. DATA WATCH Some media also described Li as a hero ""willing to speak the truth"" but there were signs that discussion of his death was being censored. The topics ""the Wuhan government owes doctor Li Wenliang an apology"" and ""we want free speech"" briefly trended on Weibo late on Thursday, but yielded no search results on Friday. The death toll in mainland China reached 636 with 73 more deaths recorded by Thursday, and 3,143 new confirmed infections, taking the total to 31,161 cases, the National Health Commission said. The 3,143 new infections were down from Wednesday's figure of 3,694 and 3,887 on Tuesday, but experts warned it was too early to say if the data represented a trend. The virus has spread around the world, with 320 cases in 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, according to a Reuters tally of official statements. Two deaths have been reported outside China, in Hong Kong and the Philippines, but how deadly and contagious the virus is remains unclear, prompting countries to quarantine hundreds of people and cut travel links with China. There were 41 new cases among about 3,700 people quarantined in a cruise ship moored off Japan, for a total of 61 cases on board. In Hong Kong, a cruise ship with 3,600 passengers and crew was quarantined for a third day after three people who had been on board were found to be infected. Taiwan, which has 16 cases, banned international cruise ships from docking. BAD WEEK FOR STOCKS Britain confirmed a third case, in which the victim caught the coronavirus after visiting an Asian country other than China. The government did not identify the country but issued a list of places, saying travellers from those countries should isolate themselves if they developed symptoms. The list included Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, as well as China. China has chafed at some travel curbs imposed by other countries, which the WHO says are unnecessary, but its internal restrictions have also been harsh. Hubei and its capital, Wuhan, have been under virtual lockdown for two weeks. The state planner said it was coordinating with state agriculture conglomerates to increase supplies of staples to Hubei. Beijing resembles a ghost town, with main thoroughfares and tourist spots almost deserted, as the country has sealed off cities, cancelled flights and closed factories, cutting supply lines to global REALes. The ramifications are being felt far and wide. Record low prices for liquefied natural gas were roiling the global gas market, while the container shipping trade is being thrown out of sync, threatening months of delays as lines re-route cargoes away from Chinese ports, industry sources say. Foreign investors are also counting the cost. Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co extended production suspensions at Chinese plants, joining a growing number of automakers facing stoppages due to supply-chain disruptions. Japan's Fast Retailing, which runs clothing chain Uniqlo, said it had temporarily closed about 370 of its 750 shops in China.

Corn ticked up after two consecutive sessions of losses, while wheat was largely unchanged. ""Soybeans are caught between large South American crop and China,"" said Ole Houe, director of advisory services at brokerage IKON Commodities in Sydney. ""At the moment, the market is likely treading water to sliding backwards until China shows their hand with a bit of real buying."" The most-active soybean contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was up 0.3% at $8.84 a bushel, as of 0259 GMT. The contract has gained 1.3% so far this week after losing 7.8% in the last three weeks. Corn and wheat were little changed so far this week. U.S. export sales of soybeans to China fell to their lowest in nearly five months in the week ended Jan. 30, a weekly U.S. Agriculture Department report showed on Thursday, amid concerns that the coronavirus outbreak would dent demand from the world's top buyer. The export sales to China totalled just 31,523 tonnes in the week ended Jan. 30, according to the USDA report. That was the lowest since the week ended Sept. 5, 2019. China on Thursday said it would halve additional tariffs levied against 1,717 U.S. goods last year, following the signing of a Phase 1 deal that defused a bruising trade war between the world's two largest economies. While the announcement reciprocates the U.S. commitment under the deal, it is also seen by analysts as a move by Beijing to boost confidence amid the virus outbreak that has disrupted REALes and hit investor sentiment. Commodity funds were net sellers of CBOT corn, wheat and soyoil futures contracts on Thursday and net buyers of soybean and soymeal futures, traders said.

2257,WRAPUP 5-American dies of coronavirus in China,"ski resort@ (Writes through, adding French ski resort, Tesla, Foxconn) * U.S. embassy confirms death of 60-year-old American in Wuhan * Five British infected at ski resort in French Alps * China death toll passes 700, approaches global deaths from SARS * For more coverage of the outbreak: https://www.reuters.com/live-events/coronavirus-6-id2921484 BEIJING, Feb 8 (Reuters) - A 60-year-old American has died of the new coronavirus, the first confirmed non-Chinese death of the illness, U.S. officials said, as millions of Chinese began returning home after a Lunar New Year break that was extended to try to contain the outbreak. While the vast majority of cases have been in China, the virus has spread to some two dozen countries abroad, with the latest such cases including five British nationals infected in a French ski resort. The American man died on Thursday in Wuhan, epicentre of the virus outbreak in the central Chinese province of Hubei, a U.S. embassy spokesman said in Beijing on Saturday. ""We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss,"" he told Reuters. ""Out of the respect for the family's privacy, we have no further comment."" A Japanese man in his sixties and hospitalised with pneumonia in Wuhan also died after suffering symptoms consistent with the new coronavirus, Japan's foreign ministry said. The death toll in mainland China rose to 722 on Saturday, according to authorities, and is poised to pass the 774 deaths recorded globally during the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Most of the deaths in China have occurred in and around Wuhan. Across mainland China, the number of cases stood at 31,774 as of Saturday. The virus has spread to 27 countries and regions, according to a Reuters count based on official reports, infecting more than 330 people. Two deaths have been reported outside of mainland China - in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Both victims were Chinese nationals. The latest patients include five British nationals staying in the same chalet at a ski resort in Haute-Savoie in southeastern France, health officials said, raising fears of further infections as British families head for the Alps during the school half-term holidays. The five had stayed in the same ski chalet with a person who had been in Singapore. They were not in a serious condition, the officials said. The Chinese economy will sputter towards normal on Monday, as millions return from the provinces to the big cities after the biggest holiday of the year. The holiday was extended, but many workplaces will remain closed and many white-collar workers will continue to work from home. U.S. electric carmaker Tesla's factory in Shanghai will resume production on Monday, a government official said on Saturday. Apple Inc said it was working to reopen its China corporate offices and call centres and was making preparations to reopen retail stores there. But Chinese authorities have blocked a plan by Apple supplier Foxconn to resume production from Feb. 10 over concerns about the spread of the virus, Japans Nikkei REAL daily reported on Saturday. The virus has been a blow to China's already-slowing economy, with Goldman Sachs cutting its first-quarter GDP growth target to 4% from 5.6% previously and saying a deeper hit is possible. ""It's certainly not going to be a return to normal next week,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics in Singapore. ""The longer this disruption continues the higher the risk it affects employment and the higher the risk of a much bigger hit on the economy,"" he said. 'HARD TO SAY HOW LETHAL' Health officials are still uncertain how deadly the illness is. ""It is hard to say how lethal this novel coronavirus infection is,"" Professor Allen Cheng, an infectious diseases expert at Monash University in Melbourne, told Reuters. ""While the crude mortality appears to be around 2%, there are likely to be many people who have been infected that haven't been tested ... We probably won't know the true case fatality for some time yet."" News of the death on Friday of Li Wenliang, a doctor who was reprimanded by police for raising the alarm about the new coronavirus, sparked outrage on Chinese social media and rekindled memories of how Beijing was slow to tell the world about the SARS outbreak. Beijing's communist leadership has sealed off cities, cancelled flights and closed factories to contain the epidemic, a response that has had ripple effects globally for financial markets and REALes dependent on the world's second-biggest economy. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong introduced a two-week quarantine on Saturday for all people arriving from the mainland, or who have been there during the previous 14 days. While China is bearing the brunt of the virus, anxiety is increasing across Asia, with Japan alarmed by the rising number of cases aboard a quarantined cruise ship, major foreign companies pulling out of an international air show in Singapore, and Thailand losing money as Chinese tourists stay home. Another three people on the cruise liner off Japan tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases from the ship to 64, Japan's health ministry said. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd on Friday banned ""any guests holding Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passports, regardless of when they were there last"" from boarding the company's ships. The World Health Organization warned on Friday warned against the ""unnecessary, unhelpful profiling of individuals based on ethnicity"".

Two deaths have been reported outside mainland China - in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Both victims were Chinese nationals. WHO expert Mike Ryan told a news conference in Geneva that the number of new cases in Hubei had stabilised over the last four days, ""which may reflect the impact of control measures put in place"". Speaking later to Reuters he cautioned, however, that ""it's not a decline. That can just mean four days of relative calm before it accelerates."" The latest patients outside China include five British nationals staying in the same chalet at a ski village in Haute-Savoie in the Alps, French health officials said, raising fears of further infections at a busy period in the ski season. The five, including a child, had been lodged in the same chalet with a British man believed to have contracted the virus in Singapore. They were not in a serious condition, the officials said. France issued a new travel advisory for its citizens, saying it did not recommend travelling to China unless there was an ""imperative"" reason. Italy asked children travelling from China to stay away from school for two weeks voluntarily. 'STAY STRONG' Hidden among the statistics are poignant tales of grief and frustration. Canadian mother Amelia Pan is at home while her two-year-old daughter, Cerena, is running a fever and stranded in Hubei where her father has contracted the virus. ""I am just hanging in there,"" Pan said in a Skype interview. ""I need to stay strong so I can fight for my family."" China's Communist Party rulers have sealed off cities, cancelled flights and closed factories, a response that has dented the world's second-biggest economy and had ripple effects globally for financial markets and REALes dependent on China.

News of the death on Friday of Li Wenliang, a doctor who was reprimanded by police for raising the alarm about the new coronavirus, sparked outrage on Chinese social media. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong introduced a two-week quarantine on Saturday for all people arriving from the mainland, or who have been there during the previous 14 days.

2297,Coronavirus updates: US citizen dies in Wuhan,"The coverage on this live blog has ended — but for up-to-the-minute coverage on the coronavirus, visit the live blog from CNBC's US team. All times below are in Beijing time. U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing still plans to attend the Singapore Airshow, the company told CNBC. ""Boeing remains committed to the Singapore Airshow and will be an active participant,"" the company said in a statement. ""In the current circumstances, and like most other exhibitors, we're adjusting our presence at the show."" Reuters on Friday reported that U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin said it will not attend the Singapore Airshow, citing the city-state's recently raised health alert. The airshow, one of the world's biggest, is scheduled for Feb. 11 to Feb. 16. The UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention confirmed two new cases of the new coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the country to seven. The ministry said the cases involve people of Chinese and Filipino nationalities.  Thailand's health ministry confirmed seven additional cases of the new coronavirus, according to a Reuters report. The cases include three Thais and four Chinese, the report said. Reuters reported that Suwannachai Wattanayingcharoenchai, director-FAKE of the Disease Control Department, said one of the Thais was a person who had been evacuated from Wuhan, while the other two had been exposed to tourists. A U.S. citizen diagnosed with the new coronavirus died in Wuhan, China on Thursday, the U.S. embassy said in a statement. ""We can confirm a 60-year old U.S. citizen diagnosed with coronavirus died at Jinyintian Hospital in Wuhan, China on February 6. We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss. Out of the respect for the family's privacy, we have no further comment,"" it said. It is the first known American death in an outbreak of a new coronavirus. Wuhan is the center of the outbreak and the capital of Hubei province, where most deaths and confirmed cases are located. —Wang Singaporean supermarket operator NTUC FairPrice said it has seen an uptick in traffic volume as people buy up household essentials. After Singapore raised its virus alert level, images began to surface online of long lines and some empty shelves at supermarkets around the city-state. On Friday, the company said, ""Several stores throughout the island experienced high traffic volume today where items like toilet paper, instant noodles and vegetables were emptied from the shelves."" FairPrice Group CEO Seah Kian Peng said in a statement there's no need to stockpile and called for calm, ""There are available stocks in our warehouses and we are looking to send them to our stores expeditiously."" The company also said it is ramping up its cleaning regimen and making hand sanitizers available for in-store customer use. —Wang On Saturday, many Hong Kong government agencies announced they would temporarily scale down office hours and services, citing efforts to limit spread of the new coronavirus. Most adjustments will take effect Monday as agencies try to continue basic, if limited, operations. The Inland Revenue Service and Labour Department are among the agencies that have announced special arrangements. The Judiciary said all hearings that had been scheduled from Feb. 10 to Feb. 16 will be FAKEly adjourned until a date that has not been set. It said, however, the courts will continue to handle ""urgent and essential"" matters. —Wang A Shanghai municipal spokesman said Tesla will resume production at its factory in the city on Feb. 10, according to a Reuters report. The news agency reported that the spokesman said authorities will give full assistance to key manufacturers like Tesla to help the resume work as quickly as possible. There's no need for citizens to panic buy household items, Singapore's trade minister Chan Chun Sing said in a Facebook post. He said the ministry is ""close contact with our retailers and I assure all Singaporeans that there is no need to rush for essential supplies like rice or instant noodles."" ""Our supply lines for these essentials are intact and there is no risk of us running a shortage of essential food or household items. We also have our national stockpile for essential items,"" Chan said. He also asked people to refrain from hoarding unnecessarily, saying ""This will create undue panic and is unhelpful to the situation at hand."" —Wang Japan's health ministry confirmed that another three people have tested positive for the new coronavirus. The government said the total cases found on the Diamond Princess cruise ship is now 64, out of 279 people tested for the virus. Kyodo News reported, citing the health ministry, that the three new cases include two Americans and one Chinese national. —Wang UPDATE: This entry has been updated with the latest information from Japan's health ministry. Toyota Motor confirmed to CNBC it plans to extend the shutdown of its plants in China for at least another week, however it is preparing to restart production after that. ""The safety and security of our team members, suppliers and stakeholders continues to be our top priority,"" the company said in an emailed statement. ""For the week of Feb. 10, all plants in China will start preparing to resume operations from the following week and beyond. We will continue to evaluate the situation."" Toyota, according to China newspaper Nikkei, which first reported the extension, had planned to restart operations at its four Chinese plants as early as Feb. 10. —Wayland Reuters reported that U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin said it will not attend the Singapore Airshow, citing the city-state's recently raised health alert. On Friday, Singapore's authorities raised its virus alert level to orange, up from yellow, as new cases show the deadly pneumonia-like virus spreading. It is the same alert level as the one declared during the SARS outbreak of 2003. It is one below the highest alert level of red, which would indicate the virus is spreading widely. —Wang and Meredith with Reuters China's National Health Commission said there were an additional 86 deaths and 3,399 new confirmed cases in the country as of the end of Friday. That brings the total cases in mainland China to 34,546 as the death toll rises to 722, the government said. —Wang The number of deaths in China's central Hubei province from a coronavirus outbreak had risen by 81 to 699, the province's health commission said in a statement on its website. There had been a further 2,841 cases detected in Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak, taking the total in the province to 24,953. The World Health Organization earlier said it was encouraged by a slowing pace of new cases over the past two days, however, this latest data reverses that trend. —Cheddar Berk with Reuters All times below are in Eastern time. Yardeni Research President Edward Yardeni said the U.S. economy was showing signs of improvement before the deadly pneumonia-like virus started making headlines. The longer this situation persists the more likely the event could weigh on stocks, possibly sparking a correction, Yardeni said. He said he would keep new cash on the sidelines until there is more clarity around the spread of the illness. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 277.26 points lower, or nearly 1%, to 29,102.51. The S&P 500 dipped 0.5% to 3,327.71. The Nasdaq Composite also slid 0.5% to close at 9,520.51. Those losses snapped a four-day winning streak for the major average. —Cheddar Berk, Imbert Norwegian Cruises imposed the strictest measures yet to prevent coronavirus. It said, ""Any guest that holds a Chinese, Hong Kong, or Macau passport, will be unable to board any of our ships, regardless of residency."" The company also announced that anyone who has traveled to mainland China or even visited an airport in the country in the 30 days prior to their cruise departure will not be allowed on the ship. The decision comes as several cruise ships around the world endure coronavirus outbreaks and scares. — Feuer Read CNBC's coverage from the U.S. overnight: The Federal Reserve flags coronavirus threat; cruise line bans Chinese nationals — CNBC's Christina Cheddar Berk, Fred Imbert, William Feuer, Riya Bhattacharjee, Sam Meredith and Mike Wayland contributed to this report, as well as Reuters."

The latest patients include five British nationals staying in the same chalet at a ski village in Haute-Savoie in the Alps, health officials said, raising fears of further infections at a busy period in the ski season. The five, including a child, had been lodged in the same chalet with a person who had been in Singapore. They were not in a serious condition, the officials said. France issued a new travel advisory for its citizens, saying it did not recommend travelling to China unless there was an ""imperative"" reason. Italy asked children travelling from China to stay away from school for two weeks voluntarily. 'STAY STRONG' Hidden among the statistics are poignant tales of grief and frustration. Canadian mother Amelia Pan is at home while her two-year-old daughter, Cerena, is running a fever and stranded in Hubei where her father has contracted the virus. ""I am just hanging in there,"" Pan said in a Skype interview. ""I need to stay strong so I can fight for my family."" China's Communist Party rulers have sealed off cities, cancelled flights and closed factories, a response that has dented the world's second-biggest economy and had ripple effects globally for financial markets and REALes dependent on China. China's economy will sputter towards normal on Monday, as millions return to the big cities after the biggest holiday of the year. The holiday was extended, but many workplaces will remain closed and many white-collar workers will continue to work from home. U.S. electric carmaker Tesla's factory in Shanghai will resume production on Monday, a government official said on Saturday. Apple Inc said it was working to reopen its China corporate offices and call centres and was making preparations to reopen retail stores there. But Chinese authorities have blocked a plan by Apple supplier Foxconn to resume production from Feb. 10 over concerns about the spread of the virus, Japans Nikkei REAL daily reported on Saturday. Volkswagen, facing supply chain disruptions, said it had postponed restarting production at most China plants in its joint venture with SAIC Motor and the Tianjin plant in its JV with FAW Group until Feb. 17. News of the death on Friday of Li Wenliang, a doctor who was reprimanded by police for raising the alarm about the new coronavirus, sparked outrage on Chinese social media and rekindled memories of how Beijing was slow to tell the world about the SARS outbreak. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong introduced a two-week quarantine on Saturday for all people arriving from the mainland, or who have been there during the previous 14 days. The Pentagon is shrinking the size of its delegation travelling to the Singapore Airshow 2020 and U.S. defence firms Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co said they would not attend. Singapore has 40 coronavirus infections. Another three people on a cruise liner off Japan tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases from the ship to 64, Japan's health ministry said. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd on Friday banned ""any guests holding Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passports, regardless of when they were there last"" from boarding the company's ships. The WHO warned on Friday against the ""unnecessary, unhelpful profiling of individuals based on ethnicity"".

2356,Xi insists China will win fight against coronavirus,"The coverage on this live blog has ended — but for up-to-the-minute coverage on the coronavirus, visit the live blog from CNBC's U.S. team. All times below are in Beijing time. Chinese President Xi Jinping insisted the country will win the fight against the coronavirus outbreak, saying he will adopt more decisive measures to contain the spread. Speaking on state television Monday, Xi said the country would speed up the development of drugs that have relatively good clinical effects against the deadly pneumonia-like virus. Xi's comments come shortly after China's National Health Commission said it had confirmed more than 3,000 new cases and almost 100 deaths as of Sunday night. The world's second-largest economy now has a total of 40,141 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the country, with 908 deaths. (See 7:48 a.m. update). Mongolia has suspended deliveries of coal across its southern border into China until March 2, Reuters reported Monday, citing the country's National Emergency Commission. The move is designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, with the commission also recommending the country suspend its Tsagaan Sar Lunar New Year celebrations later this month. Mongolia has not yet reported any cases of the coronavirus. The U.K. has confirmed four new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number in the country to eight. The new cases are all known contacts of a previously confirmed U.K. case, with the virus passed on in France, the Department of Health and Social Care said Monday. ""The patients have been transferred to specialist NHS centres in London, and we are now using robust infection control measures to prevent further spread of the virus,"" Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, said in a statement via Twitter. Earlier in the day, the U.K. declared the coronavirus a serious and imminent threat to public health. (See 4 p.m. update). The Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan confirmed 66 additional cases of the coronavirus on Monday, bringing the total number of infections to 136. The additional cases are from Japan (45), the U.S. (11), Australia (four), Philippines (three), Canada (one), England (one) and Ukraine (one). Princess Cruises told NBC News it was continuing to follow guidance from Japan's Health Ministry regarding plans for disembarkation protocols to provide medical care for these new cases. The ship was quarantined for two weeks after a previous guest, who didn't have any symptoms while aboard, tested positive for the disease six days after leaving the cruise ship. (See 2:54 p.m. update). It was not expected that additional cases would be reported involving individuals who were exposed prior to the start of the quarantine, Princess Cruises said Monday. Japan's Sony has announced it will not attend Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, later this month, citing concerns over coronavirus. ""As we place the utmost importance on the safety and wellbeing of our customers, partners, media and employees, we have taken the difficult decision to withdraw from exhibiting and participating at MWC 2020 in Barcelona, Spain,"" Sony said Monday. MWC is scheduled to run from Feb. 24 to Feb. 27. It is the world's largest telecom industry event and attracts more than 100,000 visitors each year. Amazon, LG Electronics, Ericsson and Nvidia have also pulled out of the conference. Britain has declared the coronavirus a serious and imminent threat to public health, shortly after it was confirmed that four patients in England had now tested positive for the virus. ""The Secretary of State declares that the incidence or transmission of novel Coronavirus constitutes a serious and imminent threat to public health,"" the U.K. health ministry said in a statement Monday. ""Measures outlined in these regulations are considered as an effective means of delaying or preventing further transmission of the virus."" The move will provide the U.K. government with additional powers to tackle the outbreak. The coronavirus has killed two foreigners, a U.S. citizen and a Japanese national, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Monday. That makes a total of 27 confirmed foreign cases in China as of 8 a.m. Monday, local time, spokesman Geng Shuang said, according to an official translation. He added that three people have recovered. — Cheng Japanese news outlets reported, citing a government official, that more than 60 additional people on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship have tested positive for the virus. The ship, operated by Carnival's Princess Cruises, is carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew and has been quarantined in Yokohama since early February. On Sunday, Japan's Health Ministry said that of the 336 people tested to date, 70 were confirmed to have the coronavirus. If the additional numbers reported Monday are confirmed, then that would bring the total number of infected people on the ship to at least 130. The ship was quarantined for two weeks after a previous guest, who didn't have any symptoms while on board, tested positive for the disease six days after leaving the cruise ship. Supermarkets in Singapore's Tanjong Pagar neighborhood, part of the city-state's central REAL district, had been largely replenished as of 11 a.m. Monday following a rush over the weekend that saw shelves cleared and queues snake out the door as residents rushed to stockpile goods. Shelves of household goods such as toilet paper, cleaning products and pet food remained bare Monday, but the sense of panic appeared to have abated, shoppers told CNBC. ""I think it all stems from the run in Hong Kong, but I think people are overreacting. I'm personally not too concerned,"" one man who did not wish to be named said at FairPrice supermarket's Tanjong Pagar outlet. Another woman who was looking to purchase a thermometer at her boss' instruction said she felt the sense of urgency had ""died down"" since Singapore raised its health warning to orange on Friday. As of noon Sunday, the city-state had 43 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. — Gilchrist Airbnb said it has suspended bookings of all listings in Beijing with check-in dates from Feb. 7 to Feb. 29, in guidance from local authorities for the short-term rental industry. Airbnb in a statement to CNBC said it ""will refund and support guests who had cancelled reservations. And we will continue to work diligently to build programs that support our community of hosts."" China's Ministry of Commerce issued a notice Monday telling local branches to help foreign-invested enterprises and work on attracting foreign investment in the wake of virus-related disruptions. The five-point announcement included helping the REALes resume normal production operations, improving services for foreign-invested projects and increasing transparency and fair play in accordance with the newly enacted foreign investment law. That's according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese text. The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai said Friday that of 127 companies surveyed, 87% of respondents believe the coronavirus outbreak will have a direct impact on 2020 revenues, with nearly a quarter expecting a decline of at least 16%. — Cheng Consumer prices in China rose 5.4% year over year in January, official data showed, more than the 4.9% forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. Higher food prices were the main driver of the overall rise in consumer prices. The National Bureau of Statistics of China said in a statement on Monday that last month's jump in consumer prices was due to the Lunar New Year festivities, an outbreak of a new coronavirus and a lower base of comparison with last year's prices. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: ""It appears that supply disruptions and hoarding due to the coronavirus outbreak helped to keep food prices elevated during the week after Chinese New Year, when they would normally drop back."" — Lee Women's professional golf body LPGA said Monday it will cancel two tournaments in Thailand and Singapore due to the coronavirus outbreak.  Other sports events in the region have either been canceled or postponed, such as the World Athletics Indoor Championships that was due to be held in Nanjing, China in May. The coronavirus outbreak could diminish China's international profile for two reasons, according to ratings agency Fitch. First, China will turn inward and second, foreigners will turn away, it said. ""China's political priority will be developing a strategy and implementing tactics to confront the virus and its fallout so as to preserve the leadership credentials of the Party. This will be time-consuming and resource-intensive,"" James McCormack, global head of sovereign ratings at Fitch, wrote in a note. ""Short of an unforeseen exogenous crisis, it is hard to imagine international events of any sort being given a higher priority in Beijing. In the short term, at least, an inward orientation among Chinese policymakers is inevitable,"" he said. Premier Li Keqiang discussed the coronavirus outbreak in a phone call Sunday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Li said he hoped Germany would provide necessary assistance in making it easier for China to purchase medical supplies from the European country through commercial channels, according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese text. Merkel thanked China for its assistance to Germans in the mainland. She noted that her country is willing to strengthen cooperation with Beijing in trying to prevent and control the virus outbreak, which includes providing China with medical supplies and assistance, the ministry said. — Cheng The world's largest iPhone assembler Foxconn may not reopen its factories in China on Monday as previously planned. That could potentially hit Apple and some analysts have already reduced their iPhone shipment predictions earlier this month. The Japanese REAL daily Nikkei reported on Saturday that Foxconn's plans to resume production on Monday have been called off by Chinese authorities. While Foxconn did not outright confirm that its plans to restart operations have been delayed, it told CNBC in a statement: ""The operation schedules for our facilities in China follow the recommendations of the local governments, and we have not received any requests from our customers on the need to resume production earlier."" — Yoon Investor sentiment remained dented in Asia as shares in Japan and South Korea declined. The South Korean benchmark Kospi led losses, down 1.29%, while Australian stocks also traded lower. U.S. futures also traded lower and indicated a nearly 100-point drop for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Monday's open.  Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research note that the disruption to supply chains due to the outbreak is seen as a ""major concern for the global economy due to the integrated supply chains, especially in Asia."" Both China and the world economy are set to be affected in February and March, they said. Many factories in China suspended operations as part of the country's efforts to temper the spread of the coronavirus. Reports suggest those factories may remain closed for longer than expected (see 7:36 am update). China's National Health Commission said it confirmed 3,062 new cases and 97 additional deaths, mostly in Hubei province. As of Sunday night, the government said a total of 40,171 cases have been confirmed and 908 people have died in the country. Chinese authorities initially said factories would reopen on Monday, after being shuttered as part of the country's efforts to quarantine the spread of the coronavirus. But that looks set to be delayed. In Guangdong province, China's original manufacturing belt, there has been no official notice on when factories should reopen. Many localities, instead, are urging companies to stay shut until Mar. 1. Police of the Huangpu district in the city of Zhongshan posted on their WeChat social media account that companies should not resume work before March without permission. A clothing manufacturer in Shenzhen told CNBC he had been instructed by local officials that he could not reopen his factory until he received permission from authorities. He said he is still waiting to find out what documents he needs to submit to receive his permit. — Yoon, Pan China's Hubei province reported an additional 91 deaths and 2,618 new confirmed cases related to the pneumonia-like coronavirus as of the end of Sunday. The Hubei Provincial Health Committee said that 871 people have died in the province and a total of 29,631 cases have been confirmed thus far, with most of them in the city of Wuhan where the fast-spreading virus was first detected. Hubei has accounted for most of the deaths related to the new coronavirus. All times below are in Eastern time. Fourteen Americans, including a woman from Oregon, who were on the Diamond Princess cruise have tested positive for coronavirus. Princess Cruises said in a statement that guests on Diamond Princess will receive refunds for their fares and will not be charged for incidental expenses incurred while on the ship. The company also said that it is giving the guests a future cruise credit equal to the fare for this trip. The Carnival-owned company on Tuesday put the 3,700 passengers and crew members on the ship in quarantine when it reached Japan. The move was required by the Japanese ministry of health. Amazon has backed out of the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona later this month, a spokesperson for Amazon Web Services confirmed to CNBC. ""Due to the outbreak and continued concerns about novel coronavirus, Amazon will withdraw from exhibiting and participating in Mobile World Congress 2020, scheduled for Feb. 24-27 in Barcelona, Spain,"" the company said in a statement. The World Health Organization is sending an advance team to China for an international mission, according to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.  Dr. Bruce Aylward, who is part of the advance team, previously served as a special representative for the WHO in the Ebola response effort from 2014 to 2016, according to the WHO website. Read CNBC's coverage from the U.S. overnight: Amazon pulls out of Barcelona conference, 14 Americans test positive on cruise ship — CNBC's Karen Gilchrist, Yen Nee Lee, Evelyn Cheng, Eunice Yoon, Hilary Pan, and Jesse Pound contributed to this report."

2478,EMERGING MARKETS-EM stocks stumble on coronavirus fears,"rebounds@ * Sharp rise in death toll from coronavirus hits sentiment * Turkey's lira bounces after bank regulator steps in * Russian rouble rebounds from two-month low Feb 10 (Reuters) - Developing world stocks started the week on softer footing on Monday, as a sharp rise in the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China kept a lid on buying, while Turkey's lira found stability in measures taken by a banking watchdog. The epidemic in China recorded a death toll of 97 on Sunday, the largest in a single day since the outbreak was detected in December. The fast-spreading virus has killed more than 900 people. ""Considerable uncertainty remains about when the virus outbreak will be brought under control,"" Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note. Haefele, however, remains optimistic about emerging market equities. ""The short-term impact on Chinese growth may prove to be significant, but it will also likely be temporary, with pent-up demand spurring a sharp recovery in growth from the Q1 setback,"" he said. MSCI's index for emerging market equities fell 0.4%, coming from a 2.7% weekly gain. China stocks ended the day higher, taking comfort from Beijing's steps to support the economy as workers stepped back into offices after an extended Lunar New Year holiday. Most emerging market currencies strengthened slightly versus the greenback. Turkey's lira rebounded below 6 against the dollar, after bank regulator BDDK cut the limit for Turkish banks' forex swap, spot and forward transactions with foreign entities to 10% of a bank's equity. The currency had tumbled late on Friday to its weakest level since May after the Treasury minister suggested the central bank could continue cutting rates and as the Turkish military girded for more confrontation in Syria. The Russian rouble bounced from two-month lows, rising 0.4%. Russia's currency had fallen more than 1% on Friday after the central bank cut its key interest rate for the sixth consecutive month. ""Chances are that CBR (Central Bank of Russia) will cut again in April and June also, because it is difficult to envisage the inflation trend turning around between now and then,"" Commerzbank analysts wrote in a note. Currencies in Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic were nearly flat against the euro.

2656,China stocks surge as investors shrug offvirus fears,"Stocks in Asia rose on Wednesday as investors shrugged off concerns over the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Mainland Chinese stocks were among the biggest winners regionally, with the Shenzhen component jumping 1.6% to close at 10,940.80 and the Shenzhen composite surging 1.554% to end its trading day at about 1,785.33. The Shanghai composite also gained 0.87% to close at around 2,926.90. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was 1.1% higher, as of its final hour of trading. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 gained 0.74% to close at 23,861.21 as shares of index heavyweight and conglomerate Softbank Group surged 11.89% after a judge stateside approved a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint. Softbank is a majority shareholder of Sprint. The Topix index, on the other hand, ended its trading day slightly lower at 1,718.92. Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi added 0.69% to close at 2,238.38. The S&P/ASX 200 in Australia finished its trading day 0.47% higher at 7,088.20 as shares of Commonwealth Bank of Australia surged 4.08% following the release of its half year results. Shares of Australian health supplements firm Blackmores bucked the overall trend as they plunged 12.79%. The company had earlier announced a scrapping of its dividend and the expectation that this year's profit will more than halve as its supply chain is impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, according to Reuters. Overall, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index was 0.8% higher. ""From a coronavirus perspective, I think ... the concerns have probably peaked,"" Steve Brice, chief investment strategist at Standard Chartered Private Bank, told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" on Wednesday. ""It does seem that ... the very strong actions that have been taken by the authorities are starting to bear some fruits."" Brice said markets will likely now focus on the ""knock-on economic impact"" and effect on corporate earnings as a result of measures taken by authorities in China and elsewhere in the region to tackle the virus outbreak. Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 closed 0.2% higher at 3,357.75 while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.1% to end its trading day stateside at 9,638.94. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 138 points before closing flat at 29,276.34. The moves came after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is ""closely monitoring"" the situation surrounding the ongoing coronavirus outbreak and its potential impact to China and the global economy, though he noted that it is ""too early to say"" how the disease could hit the U.S. economy. Powell's comments come as investors continue to grapple with uncertainty surrounding the virus that has already taken more than 1,000 lives, with most of them coming from China, where the outbreak was first reported. ""Based on (Powell's) comments, it is clear that the Fed is unfazed because China has taken strong measures to contain the virus and provide liquidity. There are very few cases in the US and so far, the impact on the US economy is limited,"" Kathy Lien, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, wrote in a note dated Feb. 11. Lien warned, however, that ""many factories supplying US REAL in China remain shut and flights to China remain canceled."" The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was last at 98.841 after touching an earlier low of 98.734. The Japanese yen traded at 109.88 against the dollar after seeing an earlier high of 109.76. The Australian dollar was at $0.6729 after seeing an earlier low of $0.6709. Oil prices rose in the afternoon of Asian trading hours, with international benchmark Brent crude futures up 2.06% to $55.12 per barrel. U.S. crude futures also added 1.48% to $50.68 per barrel."

2661,Oil rebounds amid broad market recovery,"Oil prices edged up from 13-month lows on Tuesday as the number of new coronavirus cases slowed in China, easing some concern over the potential for lengthy oil demand destruction. The death toll surpassed 1,000 on Tuesday, though the number of new confirmed cases fell. The epidemic could peak in February and then plateau before easing, said the Chinese government's top medical adviser on the outbreak. Brent crude gained 78 cents, or 1.4%, to trade at $54.05 per barrel. It fell to $53.11 on Monday, the lowest since January 2019. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude gained 37 cents, or 0.75%, to settle at $49.94 per barrel. ""It is way too early to definitely state that the peak of the virus is in place, but optimism is growing,"" INTL FCStone said in a note. ""Prices will mildly recover in the meantime, as the virus slowly eases, and OPEC members lack any actions moving forward thus far on steps to support prices,"" it said. Investors remain wary that China's oil demand could take a further hit if the coronavirus cannot be contained and if the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, known as OPEC+, fail to agree on further steps to support prices. ""The lack of any coordinated action by OPEC+ means that oversupply concerns are likely to retain the upper hand,"" said Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg. The virus is already denting demand in the world's second-largest oil consumer. Chinese state refiners plan to cut as much as 940,000 barrels per day (bpd) - almost 1% of world demand - from their crude processing rates in February. The U.S. Energy Information Administration cut its global oil demand growth forecast for this year by 310,000 barrels per day (bpd) after the coronavirus outbreak. Oil also got a boost from a rally in world equities, which resumed their climb toward record highs on Tuesday on hopes the virus is peaking. OPEC and allies including Russia are restraining output by 1.7 million bpd in 2020 to support the market and have been considering further curbs. An OPEC+ advisory panel proposed an additional cut of 600,000 bpd last week, but Russia has delayed delivering its official stance, frustrating some OPEC members. In a development that could add to downward pressure on prices, U.S. crude inventories are expected to rise for a third straight week, by 2.9 million barrels in the week ended on Feb. 7, a Reuters poll showed. <EIA/S> U.S. supply reports are due later on Tuesday and on Wednesday."

2678,WRAPUP 13-WHO sees coronavirus as No.1 threat,"over@ (Adds record highs in global markets) * Virus may peak this month in China - expert * In China, 1,017 people dead, 42,708 cases * Chinese firms start layoffs, need loans to survive * Coronavirus gets new name: COVID-19 * Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2uo6QJ3 GUANGZHOU, China/GENEVA, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak in China may be over by April, the country's senior medical adviser said on Tuesday, but deaths surpassed 1,000 and the World Health Organization (WHO) warned of a global threat potentially worse than terrorism. The world must ""wake up and consider this enemy virus as public enemy number one,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters, adding the first vaccine was 18 months away. China's foremost medical adviser on the outbreak, Zhong Nanshan, said numbers of new cases were falling in some provinces and forecast the epidemic would peak this month. ""I hope this outbreak or this event may be over in something like April,"" Zhong, an epidemiologist who played a role in combating an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003, told Reuters. World stocks, which had seen rounds of sell-offs over the coronarvirus' impact on China's economy and its ripple effects, surged to record highs on Zhong's comments. The Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all hit new peaks. Even if the epidemic ends soon, it has already taken a toll on China's economy, as companies began laying off workers and other firms said they would need loans running into billions of dollars to stay afloat. Supply chains for car manufacturers to smartphone makers have broken down. The WHO said on Tuesday 1,017 people had died in China, where there were 42,708 cases. Statistics from China indicate about 2% of people infected with the new virus have died, and many had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly. But the spread of the virus, which can lead to pneumonia, has already caused widespread disruption. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said China's economy was expected to ""slow noticeably"" in the first quarter and anyone pricing assets should for now consider the ""tail risk"" that the outbreak could get worse. But Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the financial spillover from the outbreak looked containable, though it was still early to judge the economic impact. 'WORST ENEMY YOU CAN IMAGINE' Tedros was less sanguine about the coronavirus, now officially named COVID-19 - CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for the year it emerged. World health organizations wanted a name that did not refer to a location or animal. ""To be honest a virus is more powerful in creating political, social and economic upheaval than any terrorist attack,"" he said. ""It's the worst enemy you can imagine."" The impact of travel curbs, lockdowns and production suspensions is being felt increasingly on China's economy. JPMorgan analysts downgraded forecasts for Chinese growth this quarter and Norwegian energy consultancy Rystad Energy predicted the outbreak would cut growth in global oil demand by a quarter this year. Cisco Systems Inc, Facebook Inc, AT&T and Sprint Corp became the latest U.S. FAKEnology companies to pull out of an international telecoms conference in Barcelona because of the outbreak. The organiser of the event, the telecom industry's biggest annual gathering, will discuss whether to cancel it, an industry source said. Inside China, more than 300 companies are seeking bank loans totalling 57.4 billion yuan ($8.2 billion) to help cope with the disruption, banking sources said. Prospective borrowers include food delivery giant Meituan Dianping, smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp and ride-hailing provider Didi Chuxing Technology Co. Chinese firm Xinchao Media said on Monday it had laid off 500 people, or just over a tenth of its workforce, and restaurant chain Xibei said it was worried about how to pay its roughly 20,000 workers. CRUISE SHIPS QUARANTINED Hubei, where the flu-like virus emerged in China from a wildlife market in the provincial capital of Wuhan, remains in virtual lockdown, its stations and airports shut and roads blocked. With public anger rising, Hubei's government dismissed the provincial health commission's Communist Party boss, Zhang Jin, and director Liu Yingzi, state media said. Washington, whose travel restrictions have offended Beijing, authorized the voluntary departure of U.S. government employees and family members from Chinese-ruled Hong Kong ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the State Department said. Dr. Anne Schuchat, an official from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said she hoped the first group of Americans evacuated from Wuhan could be released from their quarantine on Tuesday. Off Japan's port of Yokohama, the Diamond Princess cruise ship with 3,700 passengers and crew remained quarantined, with the number of confirmed cases at 135 - the largest single cluster of cases outside China. Thailand said it had barred passengers from getting off another ship, Holland America Line's MS Westerdam, though no confirmed infections have been found on board.

The 2,015 new confirmed cases took China's total to 44,653. That was the lowest daily rise since Jan. 30 and came a day after epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan said the outbreak should peak in China this month before subsiding. His comments helped soothe public fears and markets, where global stocks surged to record highs on hopes of an end to disruption in the world's second largest economy. Results from Chinese trials testing a combination of antiviral drugs used to treat HIV against the new coronavirus are due in weeks, bringing hope that experts can find an effective treatment. But the World Health Organization has likened the epidemic's threat to terrorism and WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the apparent slowdown in the spread of the epidemic should be viewed with ""extreme caution."" ""This outbreak could still go in any direction,"" he told a briefing in Geneva. Another expert said that while the coronavirus may be peaking in China, this was not the case elsewhere. ""It has spread to other places where it's the beginning of the outbreak,"" Dale Fisher, head of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network coordinated by the WHO, said in an interview in Singapore. ""In Singapore, we are at the beginning."" Singapore has 50 cases, including one found at its biggest bank, DBS, on Wednesday that caused an evacuation at the head office. Hundreds of infections have been reported in more than two dozen other countries and territories, but only two people have died from the virus outside mainland China - one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines. China's latest figures also showed the number of deaths on the mainland rose by 97 to 1,113 by the end of Tuesday, though doubts have been aired on social media about how reliable the numbers are. After a two-day WHO meeting in Geneva on research and innovation into measures to tackle the new viral outbreak, Tedros welcomed the energy and enthusiasm of participating scientists. He said a WHO-led advance team that traveled to China this week had made good progress on the composition and scope of its work. The head of the WHO's emergency program, Dr. Mike Ryan, said it was too early ""to predict the beginning, the middle or end of the epidemic."" QUARANTINED CRUISES The biggest cluster of cases outside China is on a cruise ship quarantined off the Japanese port of Yokohama, with 175 of about 3,700 people on board having tested positive. The ship's operator, Carnival Corp, is among foreign companies taking a hit from the outbreak, with many flights suspended and REALes disrupted. Planemaker Boeing said airlines were facing a fall in profits as the crisis reduces passenger demand and prolongs weakness in economically sensitive air freight. Global ship deliveries have also been dented as yards in China, one of the biggest shipbuilders, struggle to get fully back to work. There was a happy ending in sight for another cruise ship, the MS Westerdam, which Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines had refused to let dock over fears one of its 1,455 passengers and 802 crew might have the virus. Cambodia agreed to let it land, the Holland America Line said. ""This is an example of international solidarity we have been consistently calling for,"" WHO chief Tedros said. ""Outbreaks can bring out the best and the worst in people."" China's state news agency Xinhua called the epidemic a ""battle that has no gunpowder smoke"" and chided some officials for ""dropping the ball."" The outbreak is suspected to have originated in a market illegally trading wildlife in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan in December. The city of 11 million people remains under virtual lockdown. 'RACIST REPORTING'? Moves by Washington and other countries to curb visitors from China have offended Beijing, which says they are an over-reaction. Anti-Chinese sentiment has also reared on social media. A Xinhua commentary chided some Western media for ""racist reporting"" on the coronavirus and ignoring ""the unswerving efforts and huge sacrifice China and its people have made."" With companies laying off workers and supply chains from the car industry to smartphones disrupted, China's economy is taking a big hit. ANZ Bank said first-quarter growth may slow to between 3.2%-4.0%, down from a projection of 5.0%. The latest big event to be canceled was the Formula 1 Chinese Grand Prix, originally set for Shanghai on April 19.

2774,Virus containment hopes support Asian currencies,"Trade-exposed Asian currencies edged ahead on Wednesday, buoyed by optimism that the spread of coronavirus had slowed, while the kiwi leapt after the central bank dropped its easing bias. Across mainland China there were 2,015 new confirmed infections as of Tuesday, the lowest daily rise since Jan. 30. China's senior medical adviser also said the outbreak might be over by April. That news had currency markets stabilizing after a steep selldown of China-exposed assets. The U.S. dollar, which had soaked up safe-haven flows as worries about the virus coincided with strong economic data, handed back some gains. The Australian dollar, sensitive to China's fortunes because of Australia's commodity-driven export profile, firmed 0.3% to $0.6728. China's yuan was modestly stronger and the safe-haven Japanese yen was a little softer. ""Two things are giving cause for optimism,"" said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics at Mizuho Bank in Singapore. ""The rate of infections is slowing and the number of recoveries is going up faster than deaths,"" he said. ""Markets have pulled back from the verge of the cliff...they've avoided a free fall."" But levels have stabilized rather than recovered, pointing to plenty of caution remaining. More than 1,100 people have died from the epidemic in China, about 2% of people infected. The economy has also been upended, with factory closures hitting supply chains from car makers to FAKE firms. Oil prices, a barometer of global energy demand and so of growth, remain nearly a fifth lower than they were before the outbreak. The currencies of oil exporters such as Canada and Norway have been hammered, with the krone shedding 5% this year and the loonie hitting a four-month low on Monday. Despite rising on Wednesday, the tourism-sensitive Thai baht is down 4% for the year as is the Australian dollar, which briefly touched a decade-low this week. Recession fears in Europe also dragged the euro to a four-month low overnight, though it has since recovered by about 0.2% to $1.0916. The pound sat at its highest in a week after fourth-quarter growth beat sluggish forecasts. ""The main impact of coronavirus for Europe is growth,"" said Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research at Standard Chartered. ""The euro area started the year with low growth and an ECB largely out of policy options...(a) bad scenario could see an extension of recent moves and EUR/USD may head towards the $1.04/05 lows of the European debt crisis."" Elsewhere, the New Zealand dollar jumped 0.8% to $0.6462, its sharpest rise in two months, after the central bank removed the chance of a rate cut from its forward projections. It forecast a short hit from the coronavirus and predicted national growth would pick up in the second half. ""The easing bias is gone and we're back to neutral,"" said Westpac FX analyst Imre Speizer. ""It's the clearest indication that the easing cycle is probably over,"" he said, unless a deep hit from the coronavirus prompts a change of heart."

2974,Asia Rice-Thai export rates strengthen,"* Thailand could lose place as second-biggest rice exporter * 2020 Thai rice export target lowest in seven years * India rates rise on higher African demand * Coronavirus epidemic dents Vietnamese sales BENGALURU, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Local currency fluctuations helped to increase the top end of the range for Thai rice export prices this week while prices for leading exporter India rose to a more than four-month peak. The range for Thai benchmark 5% broken rice <RI-THBKN5-P1> widened on Thursday to $425-$447 a tonne from $425-$439 the previous week. ""The baht has softened, but rice prices remain expensive and this has deterred buyers,"" one Bangkok-based trader said. A strong baht resulted in 32.5% drop in rice exports in 2019, the Thai Rice Exporters Association said this week. The currency, however, has weakened of late and touched  a more than seven-month low against the U.S. dollar on Feb. 7, mainly hurt by the coronavirus outbreak in China. Traders said the prices of Thai varieties remain higher than competitors because of the drought that has hit many rice-growing regions and curbed production. ""There is a bullish feeling in the market that prices will stay high and may even go up further,"" another Bangkok trader said. The exporters association set an export target of 7.5 million tonnes for 2020, the lowest in seven years, and noted that Thailand could lose its place as the world's second-biggest rice exporter. Meanwhile, prices for India's 5% broken parboiled variety <RI-INBKN5-P1> rose to their highest since late September at $371-$376 a tonne, up from $370-$375 quoted last week. ""Demand has been trickling in from African countries,"" said an exporter based at Kakinada in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. In Vietnam, rates for 5% broken rice <RI-VNBKN5-P1> stayed flat from a week earlier at $355-$360, with the coronavirus epidemic weighing on sales. ""Many of our clients have cancelled their trips to Vietnam to check out the rice,"" said a trader based in Ho Chi Minh City. The winter-spring harvest, meanwhile, is peaking and will finish by the end of this month, traders said. Customs data released this week showed Vietnam's rice exports in January fell 4.6% from a year earlier to 410,855 tonnes. Concern over the shrinking area for rice production because of salinity keeps the prices from falling, traders said. Meanwhile, Bangladesh's rice output in the year to June hit a record high of 37.2 million tonnes, according to preliminary estimate from its statistics bureau. ""Our efforts are paying off,"" Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzak told Reuters on Thursday, adding that the government was providing subsidies to buy modern equipment to boost production and minimise costs.

3179,UPDATE 2-U.S. reports 15th coronavirus case,"response@ (Adds comment from Trump adviser Larry Kudlow, background, PIX available) Feb 13 (Reuters) - U.S. health officials reported a 15th confirmed case of coronavirus in the United States on Thursday as the White House criticized China's lack of transparency and response to the outbreak. The latest U.S. case came from a patient who was among the Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China - the epicenter of the outbreak - and placed under federal quarantine at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said a statement. It was the third evacuee and first at Lackland to test positive, the CDC said, while noting that there will likely be additional cases among people recently returned from China. The U.S. government has flown about 800 people from Hubei province, many of them government employees and their families, placing them under 14-day quarantine at U.S. military bases. ""The individual is currently isolated and receiving medical care at a designated hospital nearby,"" the CDC said, making Texas the seventh state to have a reported case. The fast-spreading virus has killed 1,370 people and infected about 60,000, nearly all in China, constraining the world's second largest economy and handing the ruling Communist Party one of its most difficult tests in years. In central China's Hubei province, officials said 242 people died on Wednesday, the biggest daily rise since the flu-like virus emerged in the provincial capital Wuhan in December. That followed a forecast earlier this week by China's senior medical adviser that the epidemic may end there by April. ""We're a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese, these numbers are jumping around... there was some surprise,"" top Trump administration economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters at the White House. The sudden increase appeared to be largely due how Chinese officials had been confirming cases. Hubei previously only allowed infections to be confirmed by a specific test that was in short supply. It has now begun identifying cases using more common lung scans. As a result, another 14,840 new cases were reported in the province on Thursday, up from 2,015 new cases nationwide a day earlier. The Trump administration was also very disappointed that Beijing had not accepted a U.S. invitation to send a team of CDC experts to help China's response to the outbreak, Kudlow said. U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month praised efforts by his Chinese counterpart in fighting the virus, saying ""President Xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation."" Kudlow said overall U.S.-China relations were still good, and that the two countries remained engaged. At the presidential level, he added, relations ""were doing fine.""

3191,Asia stocks mostly rise as investors mull virus impact,"Stocks in Asia were mostly higher on Friday as concerns around the ongoing coronavirus outbreak continued to weigh on investor sentiment. Mainland Chinese stocks gained on the day, with the Shanghai composite rising 0.38% to about 2,917.01 and the Shenzhen component up 0.48% to 10,916.31. The Shenzhen composite also added 0.441% to around 1,779.43. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was 0.39% higher, as of its final hour of trading. In Japan, however, the Nikkei 225 closed 0.59% lower at 23,687.59 as shares of index heavyweight Fast Retailing dropped 1.8%. The Topix index also declined 0.6% to end its trading day at 1,702.87. Shares of automaker Nissan plunged 9.64% after the company cut its annual operating income forecast by more than 40%. South Korea's Kospi rose 0.48% on the day to 2,243.59. Meanwhile, the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia advanced 0.38% to close at 7,130.20. Overall, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan rose 0.25%. Investors continued to watch for developments on the coronavirus outbreak following Thursday's spike in the number of cases reported after authorities in Hubei introduced a new method for tabulating case totals. On Friday, the province reported an additional 116 deaths and 4,823 new confirmed cases as of the end of Feb. 13. ""I think markets are looking at the playbook of SARS and what we found there was, it was a big hit ... to growth in the countries that were most affected but it was a V-shaped recovery,"" Rob Subbaraman, head of global macro research at Nomura, told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" on Friday. A V-shaped recovery describes  downturns that see a steep fall before recovering sharply. ""What we think markets might be missing is the depth of the V could be worse than people think,"" Subbaraman cautioned. ""The economic data we start getting for February could be a lot worse than people think."" On Friday, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the coronavirus' economic impact on the island nation's economy has already exceeded that of SARS in 2003, according to a report by local publication The Straits Times. Singapore has been among the countries worst hit by the disease as it has one of the highest reported number of confirmed cases outside of China. The Straits Times index in Singapore was last trading largely flat in the afternoon. Meanwhile, China was set to halve tariff rates on certain U.S. products worth about $75 billion with effect on Friday, as previously announced by Beijing in early February. Retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods will be cut from 10% to 5%, and from 5% to 2.5% on others, according to a statement from China's Ministry of Finance earlier this month. The adjustments was set to take effect from 1:01 p.m on Feb. 14, it said, without specifying which time zone it was referring to. On the corporate earnings front, shares of Japan's Toshiba jumped 2.27% despite posting a 145.626 billion yen loss attributable to shareholders of the company ($1.326 billion) in the nine months ended Dec. 31. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was last at 99.113 after seeing an earlier low of 99.087. The Japanese yen traded at 109.78 per dollar after seeing levels around 109.9 yesterday. The Australian dollar changed hands at $0.6722 after touching an earlier low of $0.6707. Oil prices were higher in the afternoon of Asian trading hours, with the international benchmark Brent crude futures contract up fractionally to $56.37 per barrel. U.S. crude futures were 0.12% higher at $51.48 per barrel."

3318,European shares open at record high,"(For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window) Feb 14 (Reuters) - European shares inched up to a record high on Friday ahead of fourth-quarter GDP data from the EU, while concerns over the coronavirus outbreak eased after the World Health Organization downplayed a recent spike in cases. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose as much as 0.1% to a record high of 431.42, eyeing a second straight week of gains following a relief rally earlier in the week. Investors were awaiting the European Union's fourth-quarter GDP flash estimates at 1000 GMT, which are expected to show the European economy barely expanding between October and December amid a manufacturing slump and global trade headwinds. The virus outbreak could further hurt growth, given China's position as one of the bloc's largest trading partners. Real estate and utilities were the best performing European sectors, rising 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively. (Reporting by Ambar Warrick in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)"

3345,Tokyo stocks close lower on renewed virus jitters,"TOKYO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Japanese shares ended lower on Friday as renewed worries about a coronavirus outbreak in China supported demand for the safe-haven yen and weighed on export-oriented stocks. The benchmark Nikkei average ended down 0.6% at 23,687.59, while the index lost 0.5% for the week to mark its first weekly decline in two. The broader Topix shed 0.6% to 1,702.87. ""Until Wednesday, people had been saying that you can buy shares because the number of new cases had peaked out. The reality seems to be quite different. An early end to this seems improbable,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. In its latest update, China's Hubei province health commission said on Friday that it had recorded 116 deaths and 4,823 new cases of the flu-like virus that emerged in the provincial capital, Wuhan, in December. Japan, which confirmed its first coronavirus death on Thursday, is one of the worst affected of more than two dozen countries and territories outside mainland China that have seen hundreds of infections from the flu-like sickness. (Click graphic here: https://tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7) ""Investors will surely avoid Asia for the time being and will shift funds to the U.S., geographically the most separated from the region,"" he said. That meant more demand for the safe-haven yen in the currency exchange market, which serves as a headwind for Japanese exporters' shares. All but six of the 33 sector sub-indexes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange were trading lower, with iron and steel, land transport and paper and pulp becoming the worst three performers. Nissan Motor Co Ltd tumbled 9.6% to its lowest in 10-1/2 years after the automaker cut its annual operating profit forecast by 43%, hit by a slump in vehicle sales and heaping more pressure on new management to rebuild the company after Carlos Ghosn's ouster. Toshiba Corp advanced 2.3% as the industrial conglomerate said its operating profit jumped 662% year-on-year in the April-December period, due to bold restructuring. Bucking overall weakness, SUMCO Corp surged 6.9% to become the second-most traded issue on the main board. The semiconductor silicon wafer maker projected its operating profit for the January-March quarter to fall by 54.6% year-on-year but said supply-demand conditions for 200mm wafers are tightening.

3370,RPT-Asia Rice-Thai export rates strengthen,"(Repeats without change) * Thailand could lose place as second-biggest rice exporter * 2020 Thai rice export target lowest in seven years * India rates rise on higher African demand * Coronavirus epidemic dents Vietnamese sales BENGALURU, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Local currency fluctuations helped to increase the top end of the range for Thai rice export prices this week while prices for leading exporter India rose to a more than four-month peak. The range for Thai benchmark 5% broken rice <RI-THBKN5-P1> widened on Thursday to $425-$447 a tonne from $425-$439 the previous week. ""The baht has softened, but rice prices remain expensive and this has deterred buyers,"" one Bangkok-based trader said. A strong baht resulted in 32.5% drop in rice exports in 2019, the Thai Rice Exporters Association said this week. The currency, however, has weakened of late and touched  a more than seven-month low against the U.S. dollar on Feb. 7, mainly hurt by the coronavirus outbreak in China. Traders said the prices of Thai varieties remain higher than competitors because of the drought that has hit many rice-growing regions and curbed production. ""There is a bullish feeling in the market that prices will stay high and may even go up further,"" another Bangkok trader said. The exporters association set an export target of 7.5 million tonnes for 2020, the lowest in seven years, and noted that Thailand could lose its place as the world's second-biggest rice exporter. Meanwhile, prices for India's 5% broken parboiled variety <RI-INBKN5-P1> rose to their highest since late September at $371-$376 a tonne, up from $370-$375 quoted last week. ""Demand has been trickling in from African countries,"" said an exporter based at Kakinada in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. In Vietnam, rates for 5% broken rice <RI-VNBKN5-P1> stayed flat from a week earlier at $355-$360, with the coronavirus epidemic weighing on sales. ""Many of our clients have canceled their trips to Vietnam to check out the rice,"" said a trader based in Ho Chi Minh City. The winter-spring harvest, meanwhile, is peaking and will finish by the end of this month, traders said. Customs data released this week showed Vietnam's rice exports in January fell 4.6% from a year earlier to 410,855 tonnes. Concern over the shrinking area for rice production because of salinity keeps the prices from falling, traders said. Meanwhile, Bangladesh's rice output in the year to June hit a record high of 37.2 million tonnes, according to preliminary estimate from its statistics bureau. ""Our efforts are paying off,"" Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzak told Reuters on Thursday, adding that the government was providing subsidies to buy modern equipment to boost production and minimize costs.

3390,WRAPUP 2-U.S. core retail sales flat,"* Retail sales increase 0.3% in January * Core retail sales unchanged; December revised lower * Manufacturing output falls 0.3% in January WASHINGTON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending appears to have slowed further in January, with sales at clothing stores declining by the most since 2009, which could raise concerns about the economy's ability to continue expanding at a moderate pace. The economy's outlook was also dimmed by other data on Friday showing industrial production decreased for a second straight month in January as unseasonably warm weather depressed demand for utilities and Boeing suspended production of it troubled 737 MAX plane. The reports prompted economists to lower their economic growth estimates for the first quarter. They followed on the heels of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks to lawmakers this week that the ""economy is in a very good place, performing well."" The U.S. central bank last month left interest rates steady. The Fed is widely expected to keep monetary policy on hold this year after it reduced borrowing costs three times in 2019. Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services were unchanged last month. Data for December was revised down to show the so-called core retail sales rising 0.2% instead of jumping 0.5% as previously reported. Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core retail sales rising 0.3% last month. The unchanged reading in core retail sales suggested consumer spending lost further momentum early in the first quarter after losing considerable speed in the October to December quarter. The economy grew 2.3% in 2019, slowing from 2.9% in 2018. With REAL investment continuing to falter and manufacturing struggling, solid consumer spending necessary to keep the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, on track. In a separate report on Friday, the Fed said industrial production fell 0.3% in January after decreasing 0.4% in December. Industrial output was pulled down by a 4.0 drop in utilities production. A 7.4% plunge in the production of aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment also weighed on industrial output last month. The dollar little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. BOEING DRAG Boeing last month suspended the production of the MAX plane, which has been grounded since last March following two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years is seen disrupting the supply chain. Economists estimate the production suspension could slice at least half a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth. Consumer spending is slowing despite a strong labor market, which is steadily lifting wages. Economists expect further moderation as the coronavirus makes households cautious about spending. In January, overall retail sales rose 0.3%, but data for December was revised down to show sales gaining 0.2% instead of climbing 0.3% as previously reported. Sales were lifted by a auto purchases, which rebounded 0.2% after slumping 1.7% in December. Receipts at service stations fell 0.5%. Sales at electronics and appliance stores decreased 0.5%. Sales at building material stores jumped 2.1%, the most since last August, after rising 1.3% in December. Sales were likely boosted by unseasonably mild weather, which has boosted activity in the construction sector. Receipts at clothing stores dropped 3.1% last month, the most since March 2009. Clothing retailers have been struggling with plummeting mall traffic as consumers opt for online shopping. Macy's announced this month plans to close 125 of its least productive stores over the next three years and cut more than 2,000 corporate jobs. Online and mail-order retail sales rose 0.3%. That followed a 0.1% dip in December. Receipts at furniture stores rose 0.6%. Americans boosted spending at restaurants and bars, with sales increasing 1.2%. But they cut back on spending at health and personal care stores. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores edged up 0.1%.

The economy's outlook was also dimmed by other data on Friday showing industrial production decreased for a second straight month in January as unseasonably mild weather depressed demand for utilities, and Boeing suspended production of it troubled 737 MAX plane.

The U.S. central bank last month left interest rates steady and is widely expected to keep monetary policy on hold this year after it reduced borrowing costs three times in 2019. ""The soft patch for consumer spending entered its sixth month in January,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. ""With REAL investment spending still missing in action the economy will need a more buoyant consumer to register above-trend growth."" Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services were unchanged last month. Data for December was revised down to show the so-called core retail sales rising 0.2% instead of jumping 0.5% as previously reported. Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core retail sales rising 0.3% last month. The unchanged reading in core retail sales suggested a further loss of momentum early in the first quarter after consumer spending grew at a 1.8% annualized rate in the October-December quarter. That was a step-back from the 3.2% pace logged in the third quarter. The economy grew 2.3% in 2019, slowing from 2.9% in 2018. The slowdown in consumer spending, together with a deepening downturn in REAL investment and weak manufacturing cast a shadow on the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year. The economy also facing risks from the deadly coronavirus, which has prompted economists to downgrade their growth estimates for the Chinese economy. In a separate report on Friday, the Fed said industrial production fell 0.3% in January after decreasing 0.4% in December. Industrial output was pulled down by a 4.0% drop in utilities production. A 7.4% plunge in the production of aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment also weighed on industrial output last month. U.S. stocks were mixed as investors digested the weak data and worried about the coronavirus epidemic's impact on the global economy. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. BOEING DRAG Boeing last month suspended production of the MAX plane, which has been grounded since last March following two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Economists estimate Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years could slice at least half a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth. Economists also expected the coronavirus to disrupt supply chains for manufacturers, especially electronic goods producers, though higher inventories at factories could soften some of the hit on industrial output. ""While U.S. supply chains are more integrated with China today than they were a few decades ago, inventories in the manufacturing sector are relatively high,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""That said, it can often only take a single out-of- stock part to disrupt production. Therefore, we would expect production to remain fairly weak the next couple of months."" In the wake of Friday's reports growth estimates for the January-March quarter ranged from as low as a 1.0% rate to as high as a 2.4% pace. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the fourth quarter, lifted by an improvement in the trade balance as imports declined sharply. Consumer spending is slowing despite a strong labor market, which is steadily lifting wages. There is cautious optimism for some pick-up, with a third report on Friday showing the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index increased in early February. But higher consumer sentiment has not translated into robust spending in recent months. In January, overall retail sales rose 0.3%, but data for December was revised down to show sales gaining 0.2% instead of climbing 0.3% as previously reported. Sales were lifted by a auto purchases, which rebounded 0.2% after slumping 1.7% in December. Receipts at service stations fell 0.5%. Sales at electronics and appliance stores decreased 0.5%. Sales at building material stores jumped 2.1%, the most since last August, after rising 1.3% in December. Sales were likely buoyed by unusually warmer temperatures, which have boosted activity in the construction sector. Receipts at clothing stores dropped 3.1% last month, the most since March 2009. Clothing retailers have been struggling with plummeting mall traffic as consumers opt for online shopping. Macy's announced this month plans to close 125 of its least productive stores over the next three years and cut more than 2,000 corporate jobs. Online and mail-order retail sales rose 0.3%.

3487,WRAPUP 9-Americans disembark from virus-hit cruise,"* Controls begin to show results - spokesman * Deaths in China reach 1,665 * Seventy more cases on cruise ship in Japanese port * U.S. charter flights take passengers from cruise ship SHANGHAI/BEIJING, Feb 16 (Reuters) - American passengers were taken off a cruise liner on Sunday to fly home after being quarantined for two weeks off Japan, while China said the rate of new coronavirus cases had slowed, calling that proof its steps to fight the outbreak were working. An announcement aboard the Diamond Princess, where 3,700 passengers and crew have been held since Feb. 3, told Americans to get ready to disembark on Sunday evening for charter flights home. Passengers wearing masks could later be seen waving through the windows of buses parked near the ship. Of the roughly 400 Americans on the cruise, more than 40 are infected with the virus and will stay in Japan for treatment, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). ""They are not going to go anywhere. They're going to be in hospitals in Japan,"" Fauci told the CBS News program ""Face the Nation."" ""People who have symptoms will not be able to get on the evacuation plane. Others are going to be evacuated starting imminently to air force bases in the United States."" Kyodo News Agency said the flights carrying U.S. passengers left Haneda Airport at around 1700 ET (2200 GMT). Canadian, Italian, South Korean and Hong Kong passengers were expected to follow soon, after their governments also announced plans to repatriate passengers. ""Leaving in a few hours. No details. Might be going to Texas or Nebraska,"" U.S. passenger Gay Courter told Reuters. Seventy new coronavirus cases were confirmed on board, bringing the total on the ship to 355, by far the largest cluster of cases outside China. Fauci told the Washington Post there were 44 infected Americans. Within China, authorities reported 2,009 new cases on Sunday, noting that this was down from more than 2,600 the previous day. They said this showed their efforts to halt the spread of the virus were bearing fruit. ""The effect of the coronavirus controls is appearing,"" Mi Feng, spokesman for the Health Commission, told reporters. The new cases brought the total to 68,500 in mainland China, with 1,665 deaths, including 143 fatalities reported on Sunday. Outside China, more than 500 cases have been confirmed, mostly of people who travelled from Chinese cities, with five deaths. The coronavirus is thought to have emerged at a wildlife market in China's central province of Hubei. China's response has included putting Hubei and its capital Wuhan - a city of 11 million people - on virtual lockdown. Mi said the proportion of confirmed cases who were critically ill had fallen to 21.6% on Saturday, from 32.4% on Jan. 27. He said this showed the authorities were able to treat patients more quickly, preventing cases from becoming critical. Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Britain's University of Edinburgh, said if the numbers suggested the epidemic has peaked in Hubei, ""then this would be encouraging news for the rest of the world too"". But he added: ""We should be cautious though; it could simply be that reporting is not keeping up with events in circumstances where the health services are under enormous pressure."" Declining numbers of reported new infections could mean the virus was being contained, but could also mean it was simply running out of susceptible new hosts in Wuhan, he said. Restrictions were tightened further in Hubei on Sunday with vehicles, apart from essential services, banned from the roads and companies told to stay shut until further notice. After an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China urgently needs to get back to work. But in some cities streets are still deserted. HAZMAT SUITS On board the Diamond Princess, American passenger Matthew Smith posted a photo on Twitter showing buses parked on the shore to take U.S. nationals to the airport. American officials in hazmat suits and masks had visited his room to check if he would disembark. He said he wanted to stay. The ship, owned by Carnival Corp., has been held in the port of Yokohama and those with the disease have been taken to hospital onshore. No one from the ship has died. Countries that have announced plans to fly their citizens home from the ship say they will take them only if they are symptom-free, and quarantine them on arrival. The U.S. Department of Defense is preparing to receive two flights with passengers - one to land at Travis Air Force Base, California and the other at Kelly Field/Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. The evacuees will be subject to a 14-day quarantine. Another cruise ship, Holland America's MS Westerdam, docked in Cambodia on Thursday after being rejected by ports elsewhere. An 83-year-old American passenger tested positive upon arriving in Malaysia, authorities there said. A second test requested by the cruise operator confirmed the finding. Taiwan reported its first fatality on Sunday. The first fatality in Europe was reported on Saturday, an 80-year-old Chinese man who died at a Paris hospital.

3488,WRAPUP 5-Americans to fly home from coronavirus-hit cruise,"cases slow@ * Controls begin to show results - spokesman * Deaths in China reach 1,665 * Seventy more cases on cruise ship in Japanese port * U.S., others, to send aircraft for citizens on cruise ship SHANGHAI/BEIJING, Feb 16 (Reuters) - U.S. officials in hazmat suits boarded a cruise liner on Sunday to fly home Americans quarantined for two weeks off Japan, while China said measures such as locking down megacity Wuhan had at last slowed the pace of new coronavirus cases. After being held on board the Diamond Princess since Feb. 3, American passengers were told to get ready for Sunday evening charter flights home from the cruise liner, which accounts for around half of all confirmed coronavirus cases outside China. Canadian, Italian, South Korean and Hong Kong passengers were expected to follow, after their governments also announced plans to repatriate passengers. Within China, authorities reported 2,009 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, down from more than 2,600 new cases the previous day. The new cases brought the total to 68,500 in mainland China, with 1,665 deaths including 143 reported on Sunday. Outside China, more than 500 cases have been confirmed, mostly of people who travelled from Chinese cities, with five deaths. Chinese Health Commission spokesman Mi Feng said the slowing rate of new cases was proof that curbs on travel and other drastic measures were having an impact at last: ""The effect of the coronavirus controls is appearing,"" Mi told reporters. The coronavirus, thought to have emerged at a wildlife market in the central province of Hubei, has presented the ruling Communist Party with a huge challenge. Its response has included putting Hubei and its capital Wuhan - a city of 11 million people - on virtual lockdown. Restrictions were tightened further in Hubei on Sunday with vehicles, apart from essential services, banned from the roads and companies told to stay shut until further notice. After an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China urgently needs to get back to work. But in some cities streets are still deserted. Many factories have yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond. DISEMBARK Seventy new cases were confirmed on board the Diamond Princess, bringing the total on the ship to 355. On board, an announcement from the captain blared over loudspeakers, informing American guests willing to disembark that they were scheduled to leave from 9 p.m. (1200 GMT) ""Leaving in a few hours. No details. Might be going to Texas or Nebraska,"" Gay Courter, one of the American passengers on board, told Reuters. She said she expected to spend another two weeks in quarantine on U.S. soil. Another American passenger, Matthew Smith, posted a photo on Twitter showing a fleet of about 11 coaches parked on the shore near the ship to transport U.S. nationals. American officials, dressed in full hazmat suits and face masks, had visited his room to check if he would disembark. He said he wanted to stay. The ship, owned by Carnival Corp., has been held in the Japanese port of Yokohama with 3,700 passengers and crew on board. Those with the disease have been taken to hospital in Japan and no one from the ship has died. Around half of the guests onboard are from Japan. Countries that have announced plans to fly their citizens home from the ship say they will take them only if they are symptom-free and quarantine them on arrival. PREDICTING THE SPREAD International health officials say they have no way of knowing yet how far the epidemic is going to spread. Mi, the Chinese health commission spokesman, said the proportion of confirmed cases who were critically ill had fallen to 21.6% on Saturday, from 32.4% on Jan. 27. He said this showed that the authorities were able to treat patients more quickly, preventing cases from becoming critical. Another cruise ship, Holland America's MS Westerdam, docked in Cambodia on Thursday after being rejected by ports in several other countries and territories. An 83-year-old American woman from it tested positive upon arriving in Malaysia, authorities there said. A second test, at the request of the cruise operator, confirmed the finding. Taiwan reported its first fatality on Sunday. The first fatality in Europe was reported on Saturday, an 80-year-old Chinese man who died at a Paris hospital. Robin Thompson, an expert in mathematical epidemiology at Britain's University of Oxford, said that with nearly 50 cases in Europe, a death was not surprising, but there still had not been ""sustained person-to-person transmission in Europe"".

An announcement on the tannoy aboard the Diamond Princess, where 3,700 passengers and crew have been held since Feb. 3, told Americans to get ready to disembark on Sunday evening for charter flights home. Passengers wearing masks could later be seen waving through the windows of buses parked near the ship. Canadian, Italian, South Korean and Hong Kong passengers were expected to follow soon, after their governments also announced plans to repatriate passengers. ""Leaving in a few hours. No details.

Within China, authorities reported 2,009 new cases on Sunday, noting that this was down from more than 2,600 the previous day. They said this showed their efforts to halt the spread of the virus were bearing fruit.

3553,EMERGING MARKETS-Latam stocks gain on China stimulus efforts,"takes a hit@ * Barclays latest bank to lower Brazil GDP forecasts * China cuts medium-term rate to ease coronavirus hit * Chile central bank to hold interest rate for at least a year Feb 17 (Reuters) - Stocks in Latin America edged higher on Monday as investor anxiety around the impact of a coronavirus outbreak was soothed by China's stimulus measures, but Brazil's real looked shaky after a gloomy outlook on economic growth. China's central bank cut its medium-term lending rate on Monday, which also fanned expectations for a reduction in the country's benchmark loan prime rate (LPR). The cut helped Chinese stock markets rise while lifting sentiment globally. MSCI's index for Latin American equities rose 0.2%. ""The economic impact of the stimulus, however, will struggle in the face of the measures needed to contain the spread of the virus,"" said Jane Foley, senior FX strategist at Rabobank. As the virus outbreak continued unabated, officials said the total number of cases rose by 2,048 to 70,548 as of Monday. Markets in Latin America have taken a hit from the outbreak in China, which is one of the region's top export destinations. Brazil's real fell against the dollar, as economists at Barclays became the latest bank to have cut their growth forecasts, to say the spillover from disappointing data late last year means growth this year will now be barely above 2%. The real, which was also battered in 2019 by failed oil auctions, is among the worst performing regional currencies against the greenback. In Chile, the peso weakened slightly. The country's central bank will hold its interest rate at 1.75% for at least another year, a poll of 59 traders showed, as policymakers are seen opting for long-term stimulus to ease the economic pain of months of unrest in 2019. In Argentina, analysts said on Friday the country's bond market could take another beating if debt renegotiations take longer than expected. Investors last week digested the government's unilateral postponement of a $1.47 billion payment on its AF20 bond from Thursday until Sept. 30, and comments from economy chief Martin Guzman who warned that a ""deep restructuring"" was on the way.

Korea faces economic emergency, president says BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The head of a leading hospital in China's central city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, died of the disease on Tuesday while South Korea announced an economic emergency and Singapore Airlines slashed flights. Chinese state television said Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died at 10:30 a.m, the seventh health worker to fall victim.

The total death toll in China has climbed to 1,868, the National Health Commission said. There were 1,886 new confirmed infections, for a total of 72,436. China's lockdown of cities and tough curbs on travel and movement have limited the spread of the virus outside the epicenter, but at great cost to the economy and global REAL. More than two dozen trade fairs and industry conferences have been postponed because of travel curbs and concerns about the spread of the virus, potentially disrupting deals worth billions of dollars.

Asian shares fell and Wall Street was poised to retreat from record highs on Tuesday after the news. Singapore Airlines Ltd said it would temporarily cut flights across its global network in the three months to May, as the epidemic hits demand for services to the Asian city state, as well as through the key transit hub. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the economy was in an emergency situation and required stimulus as the epidemic had disrupted demand for South Korean goods. As global REALes sought to limit exposure to the virus, health authorities around the world searched for medical weapons. The president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, Joerg Wuttke, said the world's pharmacies may face a shortage of antibiotics and other drugs if the outbreak cannot be resolved soon, and accused Beijing of making supply-chain problems worse.

3824,UPDATE 9-Oil near flat,"* Equities slip after Apple sales warning * Russia confirms OPEC+ meeting expected on March 6 * Libya's NOC oil production at 135,745 bpd as of Monday (New throughout, updates prices, market activity and comments) NEW YORK, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Oil prices were near flat on Tuesday, pressured by concerns over the impact on crude demand from the coronavirus outbreak in China, but prices drew support from a reduction in supply from Libya. Brent crude rose 8 cents to settle at $57.75 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were unchanged from the previous session, settling at $52.05 a barrel. Though new cases of the coronavirus in mainland China have dipped, global experts said it was too early to judge if the outbreak is being contained. Forecasters including the International Energy Agency (IEA) have cut 2020 oil demand estimates because of the virus. The virus is having a wider impact on financial markets. Asian shares fell and Wall Street also retreated after Apple Inc said it would miss quarterly revenue guidance due to slower iPhone production and weakened demand in China. The IEA last week said first-quarter oil demand was likely to fall by 435,000 barrels per day (bpd) from a year ago. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied producers including Russia have been considering further production cuts to support prices. The group, known as OPEC+, has a pact to cut oil output by 1.7 million bpd until the end of March. OPEC+ oil ministers will meet in Vienna on March 6 as initially planned, a senior Russian energy ministry official said on Tuesday. The group will consider an advisory panel's recommendation to cut supply by a further 600,000 bpd. OPEC has been trying to persuade Russia on the deeper cuts. Moscow has said it will disclose its stance in the coming days. ""Risk aversion has returned to the markets,"" said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch. ""OPEC+ has shown no sign yet of reacting to the virus-related slump in demand by making additional production cuts."" Supporting prices, oil output in Libya has collapsed since Jan. 18 because of a blockade of ports and oilfields. ""Supportive fundamental influences are still being seen in a continued loss of... Libyan supply availability,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia's crude stockpiles fell by 11.8 million barrels in December, despite steady shipments by the world's biggest oil exporter, official data showed. Meanwhile, U.S. shale oil output is expected to rise by about 18,000 barrels per day (bpd) in March to a record 9.18 million bpd, driven by gains in the Permian Basin, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed Tuesday.

3911,WRAPUP 4-Quarantined passengers disembark ship in Japan,"coronavirus cases fall@ (Updates with financial markets) * Passengers begin disembarking Diamond Princess cruise ship * New infections fall for second day in mainland China * Hubei capital Wuhan steps up containment measures * Experts say too early to tell if China outbreak contained BEIJING/TOKYO, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Hundreds of people began disembarking a quarantined cruise ship off Japan on Wednesday as the death toll from the new coronavirus in mainland China passed 2,000 and the number of new cases in the country fell for a second straight day. The slight decline in new cases helped Asian shares and U.S. stock futures rise as investors tried to shake off worries about the epidemic. But China, the world's second-largest economy, is struggling to get its manufacturing sector back on track after imposing severe travel restrictions to contain a virus that emerged in the central province of Hubei late last year. About 500 passengers were due to leave the virus-hit Diamond Princess cruise liner docked at Yokohama near Tokyo, NHK reported, ending an ordeal that began when the ship was quarantined on Feb. 3 after a former passenger was diagnosed with the virus in Hong Kong. The biggest concentration of infections outside China has been on the liner owned by Carnival Corp, with more than 540 people infected out of about 3,700 passengers and crew on board when the quarantine was imposed. The United States has flown home more than 300 American evacuees from the ship and other countries are queuing up to collect their citizens, including Australians, whose flight was due to arrive in Japan later on Wednesday. ""We were lucky. We booked a room with a balcony and a lounge area, but after being confined to this cabin  I am very keen to get off this ship,"" Australian passenger Vicki Presland told Reuters. Only passengers who had tested negative for the virus and did not show symptoms during quarantine would be allowed to leave the ship. Those who tested negative but were in cabins with infected people would remain on board for additional quarantine, Japanese officials said. Japan faces growing criticism over its response to the outbreak though officials defended the decision to quarantine the ship and test people on board. ""Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases, including sending infected people to hospital,"" NHK quoted Health Minister Katsunobu Kato as saying. SLOWER INFECTIONS? The promising sign out of China came from the National Health Commission, which reported the lowest daily rise in new infections since Jan. 29, or 1,749 new confirmed cases. Hubei - the epicentre of the outbreak - reported the lowest number of new infections since Feb. 11. The latest figures bring the total number of cases in China to more than 74,000 and the death toll to 2,004, three-quarters of which have occurred in Wuhan, Hubei's provincial capital. Six people have died outside mainland China, including a new fatality announced on Wednesday in Hong Kong. On top of tough steps already taken to isolate Hubei, where the flu-like virus originated in a market illegally selling wildlife, state media reported the province was stepping up efforts to track down anyone with fever. The province will check records of all fever patients who have visited doctors since Jan. 20, and people who have bought over-the-counter cough and fever medications, Xinhua reported. Chinese officials have said the apparent slowdown in infection rates is evidence that the strict measures are working but global health officials say it is too early to predict how the epidemic will play out. The number of new cases in mainland China excluding Hubei has fallen for 15 straight days. The number of new infections outside Hubei totalled 56 on Feb. 18, down from a peak of 890 on Feb 3. The head of a major hospital in Wuhan died of the disease on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to have succumbed to the virus, known as COVID-19. The World Health Organization's (WHO) emergencies programme chief, Mike Ryan, said China had success with ""putting out the fire"" first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday were monitored. Ryan also said there were no indications the coronavirus was infecting people in North Korea. Some South Korean media outlets have reported multiple cases and possible deaths in the secretive North. OPTIMISM Chinese officials have been putting on a brave face saying the economic impact of the virus would be limited and short-term. President Xi Jinping said China could meet its 2020 economic targets, media reported. Despite that optimism, foreign analysts have issued a flurry of downgrades and China's economy is still struggling, with many factories closed and others limping back to work after a New Year break that was extended because of the outbreak. The impact is rippling around the world with global supply chains disrupted for firms like Apple Inc  and major automakers. Data suggests Japan and Singapore are on the brink of recession while South Korea's president said its economy was in an emergency. Economists are warning of the possibility of mass layoffs in China this year if the virus is not contained soon.

Even as patients trundled off the Diamond Princess cruise liner with their suitcases, Japanese authorities announced 79 new cases had been discovered on board, bringing the total above 620, well over half the known cases outside mainland China. In China itself, the death toll from the coronavirus climbed above 2,000, but the tally of newly reported cases fell for a second day to the lowest since January, offering hope and helping Asian shares and U.S. stock futures rise. China is struggling to get its economy back on track after imposing severe travel restrictions to contain a virus that emerged in the central province of Hubei late last year. Beyond mainland China, six people have died from the disease, and governments around the world are trying to prevent it from spreading into a global epidemic. The Diamond Princess has been quarantined at a dock at Yokohama near Tokyo since Feb. 3, initially with 3,700 people aboard. From Wednesday, passengers who tested negative and showed no symptoms were free to leave. Around 500 were expected to disembark on Wednesday, with the rest of those eligible departing over the next two days. Confirmed cases were to be sent to hospital, while those who shared cabins with infected passengers may still be kept on board. Around half of the passengers and crew are Japanese, and are free to go home once cleared to leave. Other countries have said they will fly passengers home and quarantine them on arrival. The United States flew more than 300 passengers to air bases in California and Texas this week. ""I am very keen to get off this ship,"" Australian passenger Vicki Presland told Reuters over a social-media link. She was among a group of Australians getting off to catch an evacuation flight back to 14 days of quarantine in the city of Darwin. Matthew Smith, an American passenger who remained on board after declining the U.S. evacuation earlier this week, tweeted video of passengers departing with their suitcases. ""Captain wishes 'Arrivederci' to the guests departing the ship today but omits his usual 'Buon Appetito' to those of us who are still awaiting our fates. Hey, what are we - chopped liver?!"" he wrote. ""COMPLETELY INADEQUATE"" The rapid spread of the disease aboard the ship has drawn strong criticism of the Japanese authorities, just months before Japan is due to host the Olympics. Infectious disease specialist Kentaro Iwata of Japan's Kobe University Hospital, who volunteered to help aboard the ship, described the infection control effort on board as ""completely inadequate,"" and said basic protocols had not been followed. ""There was no single professional infection control person inside the ship and there was nobody in charge of infection prevention as a professional. The bureaucrats were in charge of everything,"" he said in a YouTube video. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato defended Japan's efforts: ""Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases,"" Kato said in a report by state broadcaster NHK. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Japan's efforts ""may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship."" From the start, experts raised questions about quarantine on the ship. Passengers were not confined to their rooms until Feb. 5. The day before, as passengers were being screened, onboard events continued, including dances, quiz games and an exercise class, one passenger said. BETTER DAY IN CHINA The promising sign out of China came from the National Health Commission, which reported 1,749 new confirmed cases, the lowest tally since Jan. 29. Hubei - the epicenter of the outbreak - reported the lowest number of new infections since Feb. 11, while outside of Hubei there were just 56 new cases, down from a peak of 890 on Feb. 3. The latest figures bring the total number of cases in China to more than 74,000 and the death toll to 2,004, three-quarters of which have occurred in Wuhan, Hubei's provincial capital. On top of tough steps taken to isolate Hubei, where the flu-like virus originated in a market illegally selling wildlife, state media reported the province would track down anyone who visited doctors with fever since Jan. 20 or bought over-the-counter cough and fever medication. Chinese officials have said the apparent slowdown in infection rates is evidence that the strict measures are working. Epidemiologists outside China have said in recent days that the reports from there are encouraging but it is still too early to predict whether the epidemic will be contained. Chinese officials have been putting on a brave face, saying the economic impact of the virus would be limited and short-term. President Xi Jinping said China could meet its 2020 economic targets, media reported. Big manufacturing hubs on the coast are starting to loosen curbs on the movement of people and traffic while authorities prod factories to get back to work.

Spot gold rose 0.5% to $1,609.63 per ounce by 1057 GMT. The metal jumped to $1,610.72 earlier, its highest since Jan. 8, when gold hit its highest in nearly 7 years. U.S. gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,612.90. ""We're still concerned that the recovery of economic activity might take a little bit longer in China,"" Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said. ""On the ground, the impact seems to be stronger than what's currently reflected in the stock markets, gold investors are taking a closer look at these developments that's why prices are higher."" Bullion held firm even as European shares hit a fresh record high on a decline in new cases of coronavirus in China, and as the dollar rose to a more than four-month high against rivals. Markets were alarmed on Tuesday after iPhone maker Apple Inc warned that its sales might fall because of slow ramp-ups in manufacturing facilities in China. Gold in euros hit an all-time peak of 1,491.01 euros per ounce. Investors await the minutes of the Federal Reserve's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting, due at 1900 GMT. Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. Indicative of investor sentiment, holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, rose 0.6% to 929.84 tonnes on Tuesday, their highest since Nov. 11, 2016. Elsewhere, palladium scaled a record high of $2,841.54 an ounce and was last up 5.2% at $2,771.77. The autocatalyst metal, which had gained 54% in 2019 on supply shortages, will be in a substantial deficit in 2020 as well, Anglo American Platinum Ltd said. ""Mine supply in not able to catch up ... despite the disappointing trend in Chinese and European car sales, tight emission norms keeps the market in deficit ... and this is visible in dwindling ground stocks,"" UBS commodities analyst Giovanni Staunovo said. Ongoing power outages in South Africa - one of the largest producers of the metal - ""just further aggravates the situation and is a supportive element,"" he added. Silver gained 1.1% to $18.36, having earlier hit a more than one-month high at $18.39, while platinum rose 2.1% to $1,012.69. (Reporting by Sumita Layek in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by K.

4043,South Korea confirms first death from COVID-19,"The coverage on this live blog has ended — but for up-to-the-minute coverage on the coronavirus, visit the live blog from CNBC's U.S. team. All times below are in Beijing time. European companies have been sending mixed signals over the potential financial impact from the epidemic. Anglo-Dutch airline group Air France-KLM warned on Thursday that the hit to earnings from the virus could top as much as $200 million. Earlier, French firm Schneider Electric said it expected the virus to cost it around 300 million euros ($324 million) in the first quarter, due to factory closures in China. Shipping giant Moller Maersk also said its 2020 outlook is impacted by the outbreak. It expects freight rates to drop due to to reduced demand for containerized goods transport. Not all companies are so downbeat, however: The CFO of carmaker BMW said the company had no indications that it could have supply issues due to the virus. Oil giant Shell said Thursday that while it saw weak market conditions ""due to record new supply coming in, two successive mild winters and the Coronavirus situation, we expect equilibrium to return, driven by a combination of continued demand growth and reduction in new supply coming on-stream until the mid-2020s."" Foxconn, the world's largest contract manufacturer of electronics and the biggest assembler of Apple products, said Thursday it is cautiously restarting production at its main plants in China, Reuters reported, but it warned revenue will be hurt this year by the coronavirus epidemic. China's Hubei province has asked firms not to resume work before March 11 due to the outbreak, although those involved in epidemic prevention and control and public utilities are exempt. The suspension of work for many firms was due to end on February 21. In a statement on its official Weibo account, the province said schools are not to re-open until further notice. - Holly Ellyatt South Korea reported its first death from the coronavirus on Thursday. The country's Center for Disease Control (KCDC) reported 22 new confirmed cases of the virus, with the deceased among that number. The cause of death is under investigation. - Holly Ellyatt An official from China's commerce ministry has identified the industries that will be heavily impacted if the coronavirus lasts a relatively long time. Li Xinggan, director of the department of foreign trade at the Ministry of Commerce, told a press conference that ""according to continuous monitoring of key areas and industries, if the (virus) continues to persist for a while, agriculture, food and labor-intensive industries with a long industrial chain are expected to be affected more,"" he said, according to a CNBC translation of his remarks. - Holly Ellyatt Japan's ministry of health has confirmed the deaths of two passengers who were on board the virus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship which was under quarantine at Yokohama Port, near Tokyo. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said on its website that a male passenger and a female passenger, both in their 80s, died after returning from the cruise ship where more than 600 people were infected. Both were residents of Japan. Separately, an employee of the health ministry, and a staff member of the Cabinet Secretariat were also infected with the virus, the ministry's said. Both worked on the Diamond Princess. — Joanna Tan Macao casinos were set to reopen on Thursday, following a two-week suspension in a bid to control the virus outbreak. The city's gaming regulator, however, imposed strict rules at the casinos, according to a report by the South China Morning Post. People at the tables were required to wear masks, and only half the tables at the gaming floor were allowed to be open, to ensure sufficient distance between people, according to the report. Casino operators that include Wynn Macau, Sands China, MGM China and Galaxy Entertainment said they will reopen progressively, according to the SCMP report. They have 30 days to open fully, it said. Shares of those Hong Kong-listed operators were down in afternoon trade. Wynn Macau fell around 1%, Sands China tumbled 2.49%, Galaxy Entertainment declined 1.21%. — Weizhen Tan Fitch Ratings said Hong Kong and Mongolia are most exposed to the economic fallout from the virus as their ""economic linkages to China are most pronounced."" In Hong Kong, ""the virus is adding to economic strains that were already elevated as a result of the territory's political unrest,"" Fitch said in its press release. ""Unresolved social cleavages combined with the consecutive political and economic shocks will test the resilience of Hong Kong's REAL environment, and may undermine its fundamental credit metrics, as reflected in the Negative Outlook."" — Joanna Tan Indonesia will help evacuate its citizens on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the country's chief development minister Muhadjir Effendy told reporters, according to Reuters. The coronavirus-stricken cruise ship is currently docked in Japan, near Tokyo. The Indonesian government has yet to decide on whether to bring back its 74 nationals on a plane or a naval vessel, Effendy reportedly said. Citing a foreign ministry official, Reuters also reported that Indonesians who were part of the crew on the cruise liner were infected. — Joanna Tan Fitch Ratings said Singapore will be among the most affected by the virus outbreak, despite setting aside $4 billion in its budget to prop up its economy. But it says Singapore's public REALs are still on ""sound footing,"" and its larger budget deficit won't affect the Southeast Asian nation's ""AAA"" rating. — Weizhen Tan Two passengers from the Diamond Princess have died, according to Japan's national broadcaster NHK, citing government sources. The two were a man and a woman in their 80s who were infected with the new coronavirus, according to NHK. The Diamond Princess has been docked at Yokohama near Tokyo since Feb. 3, with an initial 3,700 passengers, and more than 600 have since been found infected. Passengers started disembarking the cruise ship this week. On Wednesday, one group left, and on Thursday morning, another group of around 500 passengers were set to leave. Over 70 cases have been confirmed in Japan. — Weizhen Tan China's National Health Commission reported an additional 114 deaths, and 394 new confirmed cases as of Feb. 19. That brings the total deaths in the mainland to 2,118 and the confirmed cases to 74,576 cases. The number of new cases was drastically lower than the 1,749 reported the day before. Hubei reported 349 new confirmed cases, after the removal of 279 cases with negative nucleic acid test results. On Wednesday, China released the ""No. 6 trial"" measures for virus prevention and control, which removed a classification for Hubei that allowed the province to include a ""clinically diagnosed"" category. What was previously termed ""clinically diagnosed,"" or those confirmed through CT scans and symptoms, will now fall under the ""suspected"" category. They will no longer be counted as ""confirmed"" cases like they were in the previous diagnosis protocol. — Weizhen Tan, Evelyn Cheng China's central bank cut the loan prime rate on Thursday in a widely-anticipated move that will help lower borrowing costs for REALes, and prop up the economy that is reeling from the virus outbreak.The one-year loan prime rate was reduced by 10-basis points — from 4.15% in January to 4.05% in February. The five-year LPR was lowered by 5-basis points — from 4.8% to 4.75%. The LPR is the interest rate that banks charge their most creditworthy customers. In August last year, the People's Bank of China changed the way commercial lenders set interest rates for loans. — Joanna Tan South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed another 31 new cases, bringing the total number of people infected to 82. One case was identified in the capital of Seoul, the rest were in the city of Daegu and the Gyengbuk province, KCDC said. — Joanna Tan More than 150 Australians have disembarked the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship docked off Japan, and have arrived back in their country, according to Reuters. They will serve out a two-week quarantine. They arrived in Darwin on Thursday morning, according to the report. A second group of about 600 passengers — Japanese and other nationalities — are set to disembark the ship on Thursday as well, according to a separate Reuters report. The Diamond Princess has been docked at Yokohama near Tokyo since Feb. 3, with an initial 3,700 passengers, and more than 600 have since been found infected. — Weizhen Tan Hubei's health authorities reported there were 108 additional fatalities on Feb. 19, bringing the total number of people who died in the province to 2,029. The Hubei Provincial Health Committee reported there were 349 new cases on Feb. 19 — down from 1,693 newly confirmed cases the day before. The commission stated that 349 was the final tally after deducting 279 cases from 10 Hubei cities. According to Reuters, the number of new cases reported daily is a net figure including such deductions. That means the number of new cases on Wednesday stood at 628, when the deductions were removed. The virus — believed to have first emerged from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province — has killed more than 2,000 people so far. Less than 10 people outside the mainland have died from the virus. — Joanna Tan All times below are in Eastern time. The coronavirus may significantly weaken a global economy that was already in a precarious position, Yale University's Stephen Roach told CNBC. ""If the global economy is as weak as I think it is in the first half of this year, that points to a pretty serious reckoning for frothy financial markets,"" the former Morgan Stanley Asia chairman said on ""Closing Bell."" Investors have been trying to make sense of what the coronavirus means for REALes since late January. And yet, the market has only seen a few pullbacks in that stretch as the major U.S. stock indexes continue to set fresh highs. — Stankiewicz Goldman Sachs sounded the alarm to clients about a possible correction in the stock market, noting investors are underestimating how big of a risk the coronavirus really is. ""We believe the greater risk is that the impact of the coronavirus on earnings may well be underestimated in current stock prices, suggesting that the risks of a correction are high,"" strategist Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a note. Oppenheimer thinks the market could be in trouble if earnings expectations aren't ratcheted down. ""Equity markets are looking increasingly exposed to near-term downward surprises to earnings growth,"" said Oppenheimer. ""While a sustained bear market does not look likely, a near-term correction is looking much more probable."" — Imbert The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidelines on Wednesday for American travelers to Hong Kong after the city reported its second death from the new coronavirus. Travelers to Hong Kong should avoid contact with sick people, the CDC said, and regularly wash their hands. It is the CDC's lowest-level travel warning, but it is the first coronavirus-related travel notice issued by the U.S. government for a territory beyond mainland China. — Feuer Read CNBC's coverage from the U.S. overnight: Fed sees risk to global growth, markets face 'pretty serious reckoning' — CNBC's Evelyn Cheng, Eunice Yoon, Fred Imber and Kevin Stankiewicz contributed to this report."

There was encouraging news on the struggling manufacturing sector, with other data on Thursday showing factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated to a three-year high in February, likely as tensions in the 19-month trade war between the United States and China diminished. Washington and China signed a Phase 1 trade deal in January. Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Jan. 28-29 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers ""expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace,"" but expressed concern about possible economic risks from the coronavirus which has killed more than 2,000 people, mostly in China. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended Feb. 15, the Labor Department said.  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 210,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 to 209,000 last week. U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data. SOLID LABOR MARKET The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed REAL establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of February's employment report. Claims fell 13,000 between the January and February survey weeks, suggesting solid job growth this month. The economy created 225,000 jobs in January after adding 147,000 positions in December. The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.6% as more people entered the labor force, a sign of confidence in their job prospects. Wednesday's Fed's minutes showed policymakers ""judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong,"" and ""expected payroll employment to expand at a healthy pace this year."" Labor market momentum could slow this year, with job openings dropping to a two-year low in December. In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its REAL conditions index jumped to a reading of 36.7 in February, the highest since February 2017, from 17.0 in January. The survey's measure of new orders received by factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, soared to 33.6 this month from a reading of 18.2 in January. But a measure of factory employment slipped. The survey came on the heels of a report from the New York Fed on Tuesday showing a measure of REAL activity in New York state jumped to a nine-month high in February. Despite the signs of improvement the risks for manufacturing, which makes up about 11% of the economy, are stacked to the downside. Boeing last month suspended production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, grounded last March after two fatal crashes. Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years hurt industrial production in January. The coronavirus outbreak, which has also infected thousands globally, is disrupting global supply chains. Apple warned on Monday it was unlikely to meet its March quarter sales guidance set just three weeks ago because of the coronavirus epidemic, which is delaying reopening of factories in China after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break. The Philadelphia Fed survey's six-month REAL conditions index increased to a reading of 45.4 this month from 38.4 in January. Its six-month capital expenditures index fell to 29.8 from a reading of 32.9 in the prior month. (Reporting By Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)"

4094,WRAPUP 1-China records drop in new coronavirus cases,"from quarantined ship@ * New infections fall to 349 in Hubei province * Two deaths reported from quarantined ship-NHK * Sth Korea reports spike in infections linked to church * Scientists warn coronavirus like flu, may spread easily * Iran deaths bring toll outside mainland China to 8 BEIJING, Feb 20 (Reuters) - China reported a dramatic drop in new coronavirus infections on Thursday although scientists warned the flu-like pathogen may spread even more easily than previously believed, while more passengers disembarked a quarantined cruise ship off Japan. Two elderly passengers from the quarantined Diamond Princess ship had died of the disease, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported. The passengers were a man and a woman in their 80s, NHK said, citing an unidentified government source. South Korea reported a spike in infections, with 23 new cases linked to a church congregation, up from 14 on Wednesday, in what health officials called a ""super-spreading event"". A 61-year-old woman known as ""Patient 31"" is suspected of passing the disease to others who attended religious services at a church in the central city of Daegu. Hundreds of people are believed to have attended services with the woman in recent weeks at a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, a religious movement founded in 1984 by South Korean Lee Man-hee, who is revered as a messiah by followers. Scientists in China who studied nose and throat swabs from 18 patients infected with the new coronavirus say it behaves much more like influenza than other closely related viruses, and could be passed on by people before they show symptoms. The preliminary findings published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine offer evidence that the novel coronavirus is not like other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). ""If confirmed, this is very important,"" said Dr. Gregory Poland, a sinologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved with the study. While the latest numbers on infections in mainland China suggest the epidemic there is slowing, it is unclear how much the fall in new cases is due to changes in diagnostic methodology or because fewer people are contracting the disease. China's central Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, reported 349 new confirmed cases, down from 1,693 a day earlier and the lowest since Jan. 25. The death toll in the province rose by 108, bringing to total in China to over 2,100 deaths and 74,500 cases. Two people died of the disease in Iran on Wednesday, Iranian officials said, bringing the death toll outside mainland China to eight. If the reported deaths on the quarantined ship are confirmed the toll outside mainland China would stand at 10. CRUISE SHIP In Japan, the government has come under intense criticism for its handling of an outbreak on a cruise ship carrying about 3,700 people, that was placed in quarantine off Yokohama on Feb. 3. A second group of about 600 Japanese and foreign passengers from the Diamond Princess was set to disembark on Thursday, after the first batch were released from quarantine a day earlier. Hundreds of people who left the chip on Wednesday were placed in quarantine again in their home countries, with Australia and Hong Kong putting their returned citizens in supervised isolation for another two weeks. Passengers arriving in Hong Kong were taken straight into quarantine at a new public housing estate. A contingent of Australian evacuees were placed in quarantine at an old mining camp outside Darwin in the country's far north. Even as the first passengers disembarked on Wednesday, Japanese authorities announced 79 new cases had been discovered on board, bringing the total to at least 620, over half of the known infections outside mainland China. From the start, experts raised questions about quarantine on the ship. Passengers were not confined to rooms until Feb. 5. The day before, as passengers were being screened, ship events continued, including dances, quiz games and an exercise class.

China reported a sharp drop in new cases but the data was partly attributable to a change in how it diagnoses the virus and the figures could not quell growing alarm about its spread. Everything from the Australian dollar to the Indian rupee came under fire on foreign exchange markets as concern about the coronavirus drove investors to look for safety in the U.S. currency. ""People are trying to get far away from the economic fallout that we might see from the coronavirus. You want your capital as far away from China as possible,"" said Chris Weston, Melbourne-based head of research at broker Pepperstone. The coronavirus emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December, apparently in a wildlife market, and has now infected some 75,000 people and killed about 2,100. The vast majority of cases and deaths have been in China, and more specifically Hubei province, but the global spread appears inexorable. The mayor of South Korea's fourth-largest city urged residents to stay indoors after a spike of 23 new infections were traced to church services attended by a woman who tested positive. Malls and cinemas in the city of Daegu were empty and its usually bustling downtown streets were quiet in scenes one resident likened to a ""disaster movie"". Daegu Mayor Kwon Young-jin asked the city's 2.5 million residents to stay indoors as officials said at least 90 of more than 1,000 other people who attended the church were showing symptoms from what Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention described as a ""super-spreading event"". ""We are in an unprecedented crisis,"" Kwon told reporters, adding that all members of the church would be tested. ""We've asked them to stay at home isolated from their families."" The situation was ""very grave"", South Korean Vice Health Minister Kim Kang-lip said at a separate briefing. South Korea now has 82 confirmed cases of the flu-like virus that emerged for China late last year. NEW METHOD, NEW FIGURES Japanese media reported the death of two elderly passengers from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship anchored off Yokohama, the biggest cluster of infection outside mainland China with more than 620 cases. A second group of about 600 Japanese and foreign passengers from the ship was set to disembark on Thursday, after the first batch were released from quarantine a day earlier. The ship was carrying about 3,700 people when quarantined on Feb. 3. Hundreds of people who left the ship on Wednesday were placed in quarantine again in their home countries, with Australia and Hong Kong putting their returned citizens in supervised isolation for another two weeks. Two people died of the disease in Iran on Wednesday, Iranian officials said, bringing the death toll outside mainland China to 10, according to a Reuters tally based on official statements. China's Hubei province, which accounts for the majority of cases, reported a drop in new infections after it stopped diagnosing people using chest X-rays and counted only those who tested positive for genetic traces of the coronavirus. The change in the method and in the data, China's second in just over a week, has raised questions about the extent to which daily tallies accurately reflect the state of the outbreak. Hubei reported 349 new confirmed cases on Thursday, down from 1,693 a day earlier and the lowest since Jan. 25. The death toll in the province rose by 108. Excluding Hubei, the number of new confirmed cases in mainland China fell for the 16th consecutive day to 45. 'VERY IMPORTANT' While the numbers suggested a downward trend, scientists in China who studied nose and throat swabs from 18 patients say the virus could be more contagious than previously thought. The preliminary findings published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine show the virus behaves much more like influenza than other closely related viruses and can be passed on by people before they show symptoms. ""If confirmed, this is very important,"" said Dr Gregory Poland, a vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved with the study. China, the world's second largest economy, cut its benchmark lending rate in an effort to lower costs for struggling REALes, as the epidemic disrupts global supply chains. With Hubei province, home to some 60 million people, in virtual lockdown, strict limits on movement in several major cities, and bans on travel to and from the mainland, economists expect China's economy to take a short-term hit from the epidemic.

4102,Tokyo shares close higher as weaker yen lifts automakers,"TOKYO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks ended higher on Thursday as a rapidly weakening yen, which hit a near 10-month low versus the dollar overnight, lifted export-focused automakers, but the gains were capped by concerns over the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The benchmark Nikkei average ended up 0.3% at 23,479.15, while the broader Topix added 0.2% to 1,674.48. Both indexes erased most of their early gains on news that two passengers from the virus-hit cruise ship moored near Tokyo have died and 29 people were in a serious condition, analysts said. About two-thirds of the 33 sector sub-indexes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange finished in positive territory, with mining , transport equipment and paper and pulp being the top three performers. The yen dived to its lowest level since early May versus the dollar of overnight, providing a tailwind for Japanese exporters as a weaker local currency boosts corporate profits when they are repatriated. Toyota Motor Corp advanced 2.8%, while Honda Motor Co Ltd rose 2.2% and Subaru Corp added 2.4%. The Nikkei's heavyweight SoftBank Group climbed 3.4% after the FAKE conglomerate said it plans to borrow up to 500 billion yen ($4.5 billion) from 16 domestic and foreign financial institutions using almost a third of its stake in telco SoftBank Corp as collateral. Seven & i Holdings tumbled 8.8% after Bloomberg reported that the retail group is in exclusive talks to buy Marathon Petroleum Corp's Speedway REAL. However, Seven & i said the firm is considering acquisitions but nothing has been decided.

E*Trade jumped 24.2% after Morgan Stanley offered to buy it in a $13 billion stock deal, the biggest acquisition by a Wall Street bank since the global financial crisis. Morgan Stanley's shares fell 3.9%. The mood elsewhere was more subdued, as the number of new coronavirus cases climbed in South Korea and Japan reported two new deaths. Research also suggested that the virus was spreading faster than previously thought. ""There is still uncertainty about how long this (outbreak) is going to last and how big the economic effect is going to be, not just on China, but on supply chains around the world,"" Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida, said. Recent data from China has pointed to a slowdown in the outbreak, but the figures partly reflect a change in the diagnostic method, adding a degree of skepticism to whether the daily tallies accurately reflect the spread of the virus. ""There is longer term optimism,"" said Brown. ""Once (the virus) is contained, you are going to see a snap back in growth."" Recent policy easing by China, a largely better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings season and hopes that the economic jolt from the coronavirus will be short-lived have pushed Wall Street's main indexes to new highs in recent weeks. Investors also digested comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida, who showed little alarm about the potential of the coronavirus outbreak to alter the central bank's interest rate policy and said the domestic economy is strong. At 10:00 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 19.67 points, or 0.07%, at 29,328.36; the S&P 500 was down 0.41 points, or 0.01%, at 3,385.74; and the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.95 points, or 0.04%, to 9,813.23. Five of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower with healthcare stocks leading losses. Energy stocks firmed 0.6%, tracking higher oil prices. In other corporate news, ViacomCBS Inc slumped 18% as its earnings fell short of revenue and profit expectations in its first quarterly earnings results since closing its merger.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.48-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.25-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

China's central Hubei province had 349 new confirmed cases on Wednesday, down from 1,693 a day earlier and lowest since Jan. 25. The death toll rose by 108, down from 132 the previous day, bringing to total in China to over 2,100 deaths and 74,000 cases. The new figures include subtracting 279 cases in the province that were not confirmed, a larger-than-usual number. No explanation was given. Excluding the deductions, the number of new cases on Wednesday stood at 628, still a large drop. China is struggling to get its economy back on track after imposing severe travel restrictions to contain a virus that emerged in the central province of Hubei late last year. Beyond mainland China, six people have died from the disease, and governments around the world are trying to prevent it from spreading into a global pandemic. Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd said on Thursday it will ground the equivalent of 18 planes, freeze recruitment and ask its 30,000 staff to use up annual leave as it grapples with falling demand from Asia due to the coronavirus epidemic. Scientists published on Wednesday preliminary findings in the New England Journal of Medicine that suggested the virus spreads easily, including through patients who have no symptoms. ""If confirmed, this is very important,"" said Dr. Greg Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved with the study. HEADING HOME Hundreds of passengers trundled off a cruise ship in Japan on Wednesday after being held on board in quarantine for more than two weeks, as criticism mounted of Japan's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Even as passengers rolled their luggage off the Diamond Princess cruise liner, Japanese authorities announced 79 new cases had been discovered on board, bringing the total to at least 620, well over half of the known cases outside mainland China. The Diamond Princess has been quarantined near Tokyo since Feb. 3, initially with about 3,700 people aboard. The rapid spread of the disease on board led to criticism of the Japanese authorities just months before Japan is due to host the Olympics. From Wednesday, passengers who tested negative and showed no symptoms were free to leave. Around 500 were expected to disembark on Wednesday, with the rest of those eligible leaving over the next two days. Confirmed cases were to be sent to hospital, while those who shared cabins with infected passengers may still be kept on board. Around half of the passengers and crew are Japanese, and are free to go home once cleared to leave. Other countries, including Canada, have said they will fly passengers home and quarantine them on arrival. The United States flew more than 300 passengers to air bases in California and Texas this week. ""I am very keen to get off this ship,"" Australian passenger Vicki Presland told Reuters over a social-media link. She was among a group of Australians catching an evacuation flight back to 14 days of quarantine in the city of Darwin. ""COMPLETELY INADEQUATE"" Infectious disease specialist Kentaro Iwata of Japan's Kobe University Hospital, who volunteered to help aboard the ship, described the infection control effort as ""completely inadequate"" and said basic protocols had not been followed. ""There was no single professional infection control person inside the ship and there was nobody in charge of infection prevention as a professional. The bureaucrats were in charge of everything,"" he said in a YouTube video. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato defended Japan's efforts. ""Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases,"" Kato said in a report by state broadcaster NHK. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Japan's efforts ""may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship."" Clyde and Renee Smith, 80-year-old American cruise passengers hospitalised in Japan since testing positive for the virus on Feb. 3, learned on Wednesday they were still positive. ""We are very happy here,"" Clyde said from the couple's hospital room in western Tokyo. ""They're taking excellent care of us. This is the newest, fanciest hospital I've ever seen."" From the start, experts raised questions about quarantine on the ship. Passengers were not confined to rooms until Feb. 5. The day before, as passengers were being screened, events continued, including dances, quiz games and an exercise class.

4305,FOREX-Dollar dented as data disappoints,"* Yen bounces after worst 2-day performance since September 2017 * U.S. services, manufacturing sectors hit wall in February * Euro, pound get respite after better-than-expected PMI data (Updates to U.S. afternoon) NEW YORK, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell across the board on Friday after a survey of purchasing managers showed U.S. REAL activity in the manufacturing and services sectors stalled in February and as  investors fretted over the fast-spreading coronavirus. The IHS Markit flash services sector Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to 49.4 this month, the lowest since October 2013 and signaling that a sector accounting for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy was in contraction for the first time since 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 53. The manufacturing sector barely escaped a slip into contraction, with a flash reading of 50.8, the lowest since August. Against a basket of six other currencies, the U.S. dollar was down 0.59%. The euro was 0.68% higher against the greenback. Business activity in the euro zone picked up more than expected this month, a REAL survey showed on Friday, in welcome news for policymakers at the European Central Bank, who are trying to revive growth and chronically low inflation. ""There are finally signs that the euro zone can indeed recover, perhaps slowly, and if things are going to go the way of contraction here in the U.S., that plays poorly for the buck,"" said Juan Perez, senior foreign exchange trader and strategist at Tempus Inc. The dollar's broad weakness and increased demand for safe havens helped the yen pull back from a 10-month low hit in the previous session. The yen, which lost 2% against the dollar in the previous two days amid worries about the health of the Japanese economy, was up 0.5% against the greenback on Friday. Coronavirus cases in South Korea and Japan, coupled with this week's dismal economic news out of Japan that stirred talk the country is already in recession, pressured the Japanese currency this week. ""Fundamentally, the case is clearly a bearish one for the yen, though the dynamics underpinning the currency as a safe haven should keep the Japanese currency on the list of outperforming currencies,"" Jonathan Coughtrey, managing director at Action Economics, said in a note. The yen typically rises during geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the world's biggest creditor nation. The new coronavirus has infected hundreds of people in Chinese prisons, authorities said on Friday, contributing to a jump in reported cases beyond the epidemic's epicenter in Hubei province, including 100 more in South Korea. The Australian dollar recovered ground to trade up 0.2% against its U.S. counterpart after slipping to an 11-year low on Friday. The impact of the coronavirus epidemic in China, the biggest export market for Australia, has pressured the Aussie in recent sessions. The New Zealand dollar was up 0.41%, pulling back from a more than three-month low hit on Thursday. Sterling rose against the dollar after British factories reported the fastest rise in output for 10 months in February, assuaging some fears over the economy as Britain prepares for trade talks with the European Union. The pound was up 0.72% against the greenback. (Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Andrea Ricci)"

4336,Possible US coronavirus pandemic,"Coverage on this live blog has ended. For the latest updates, visit the live blog from CNBC's Asia-Pacific team. All times below are in Eastern time. Thousands of DuPont employees are working around the clock to increase production of protective garments that are in high demand by first responders and medical workers in high-impact regions like Wuhan, China. The protective suits are used by health professionals during the outbreaks to reduce the risk of infection. Reports from China show workers running low on safety supplies including garments and masks. —Mody and Manning Online travel booking company Trip.com is pushing back its fourth-quarter earnings report from Feb. 26 to March 18 to tally the impact of the outbreak on its ticketing and tour REAL, the company said. ""The revised date would give the company more time to observe REAL conditions and provide visibility for the first quarter of 2020,"" the company said. —Kopecki The coronavirus outbreak ruined for investors what was a solid earnings reporting season and is casting a pall on forecasts for this quarter and the rest of this year. And now with most of the earnings season in the books, look for the latest coronavirus headlines to fill the vacuum and weigh on stocks the rest of the month. Fourth-quarter profit growth for S&P 500 companies came in at 3.1%, and if the energy sector is excluded, the growth rate was 6.0%, according to Refinitiv. Just about four weeks ago, analysts expected a slight decline. However, the deluge of solid corporate results was largely overlooked by investors who are focusing on the spillover impact from the coronavirus on U.S. corporations. —Li Airlines have canceled more than 200,000 flights as the coronavirus continues to spread to new countries, prompting travel restrictions and a sharp drop in demand for trips to and within China. Between Jan. 23 and Feb. 18, 99,254 scheduled flights didn't fly, close to 90% of them domestic trips, aviation consulting firm Cirium said. That's sending jet-fuel prices, FAKEly airlines' second-biggest expense after labor, down sharply. While benchmark jet-fuel prices in the U.S. and Singapore have recovered some ground from hitting the lowest levels since mid-2017, they're each down 17% so far this year, according to data from S&P Global Platts. —Josephs California, Nebraska and Illinois are the only U.S. states that can currently test for coronavirus, the Association of Public Health Laboratories told Reuters. The CDC last week said some of the testing kits sent to U.S. states and at least 30 countries produced ""inconclusive"" results due to a flawed component, and the CDC planned to send replacement materials to make the kits work. The CDC has increased testing capacity until new testing kits become available, said Scott Becker, the executive director of APHL, which represents public health laboratories in the United States. —Reuters An outbreak of coronavirus in northern Italy worsened, with officials announcing 14 confirmed cases in the wealthy region of Lombardy, while two cases were reported in the adjacent region of Veneto. Just hours after revealing that six people had come down with the virus in the first known cases of local transmission in Italy, officials said a further eight had tested positive for the disease, including five health workers. Separately, ANSA news agency said two people had been diagnosed as suffering from the highly contagious illness in Veneto, although it was not immediately clear if the cases were connected. —Reuters U.S. health officials are preparing for the COVID-19 coronavirus to become a pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. ""We're not seeing community spread here in the United States, yet, but it's very possible, even likely, that it may eventually happen,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on a conference call. ""Our goal continues to be to slowing the introduction of the virus into the U.S. This buys us more time to prepare communities for more cases and possibly sustained spread."" Messonnier pointed to China where schools and REALes have been shuttered for weeks to contain the outbreak there, saying the U.S. may eventually need to do the same. ""The day may come where we may need to implement such measures in this country,"" she said. — Lovelace, Feuer Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, has begun testing individuals at local social welfare institutions, the municipal government said in an online statement. The investigation is a response to a Chinese citizens' complaints on social media that 11 elderly people died from fever and respiratory failure since the quarantine for the new coronavirus began on Jan. 21. Wuhan's Civil Affairs Bureau reported that at a welfare institute for more than 600 elderly people, there were 12 cases – one worker and 11 among the elderly, including one death. Data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has found the sick and elderly most at risk. — Wu World health officials said the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak in Iran, where there are 18 confirmed cases and four deaths in just two days, is ""very worrisome."" Earlier in the day, Iran confirmed 13 new coronavirus cases. Seven people found to have contracted the flu-like virus were diagnosed in Qom, four people in Tehran and two in Gilan. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-FAKE of the World Health Organization, said a 45-year-old woman in Lebanon has been linked to the outbreak in Iran. ""The cases that we see in the rest of the world, although the numbers are small, but not linked to Wuhan or China, it's very worrisome,"" he said. ""These dots are actually very concerning."" — Lovelace While Chinese authorities try to control the spread of the new virus, they are moving quickly to stall its impact on the economy, especially on people's jobs. This past Tuesday, the powerful State Council decided at a meeting to waive some REAL' contributions to social insurance plans through June, and emphasized that ""stable employment"" must be a priority. These policy moves also come as the country begins a gradual return to work in manufacturing, FAKEnology and other major industries. The coronavirus forced more than half of the country to shut down for at least a week longer than planned for Lunar New Year's celebrations. About a third of 1,000 Chinese companies surveyed in the last week by research firm China Beige Book remain closed, and roughly another third are operating remotely. — Cheng The coronavirus has spread to several Iranian cities, a Health Ministry official said Friday, as an outbreak that the authorities say began in the city of Qom caused two more deaths. Iran confirmed 13 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total in the country to 18, with four of the total having died. The majority of coronavirus cases in Iran have been in Qom, a Shiite Muslim holy city 75 miles south of the capital Tehran. The new cases comprised seven people diagnosed in Qom, four in the capital Tehran and two in Gilan province, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a tweet. Health officials had called for the suspension of all religious gatherings in Qom. ""It's clear that new coronavirus has circulated in the country and probably the source of this illness was Chinese workers who work in the city of Qom and had traveled to China,"" Health Ministry official Minou Mohrez said, according to the official IRNA news agency. — Reuters World Health Organization officials are holding a news conference at 10 a.m. ET Friday to update the public on the outbreak. WHO officials declared the virus a global health emergency last month, while urging the public against overreacting to the virus. However, the COVID-19 epidemic in China has not yet met world health officials' designation of a global pandemic that spreads far and wide throughout the world. While it has spread to more than two dozen countries, international health officials say there's little transmission on local levels outside of China right now. They have warned that could quickly change. Watch the live news conference here. — Feuer Organizers of the Mobile World Congress pulled the plug on the show — and the 100,000 visitors it normally draws — less than two weeks before it was set to start Monday in Barcelona, Spain, marking a turning point for companies in the global battle against a new virus that's killed more than 2,100 in China over the last seven weeks. Since the disease, named COVID-19, emerged from the city of Wuhan in late December, U.S. airlines have cut service to much of China and Hong Kong and dozens of trade exhibitions and conferences have been canceled or postponed. Major corporations have pulled their executives from attending conferences across the globe, including major trade shows in the U.S., as fears of a possible pandemic spread of the virus gripped the world meeting market. — Miller The first case of coronavirus was confirmed in Lebanon on Friday after a woman arriving from Iran tested positive, a source at a Beirut hospital where the woman is being quarantined told Reuters. There were no further details immediately available on the case. Lebanon's health minister was expected to hold a news conference on Friday to address the case. — Reuters Markets that are expecting an interest rate cut are reacting to the coronavirus scare and likely will reverse once the fear starts to fade, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said. In an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" Bullard pushed back on the likelihood of a cut, saying current policy seems right considering the pace of the record-breaking U.S. economic expansion. ""There's a high probability that the coronavirus will blow over as other viruses have, be a temporary shock and everything will come back. But there's a low probability that this could get much worse,"" he said. ""Markets have to price that in, and that drags down the center of gravity a little bit. But if this all goes away, I expect that pricing will come back out of the market and we'll be back to the on-hold scenario."" — Cox Iran's Health Ministry on Friday reportedly confirmed the coronavirus had spread to several cities nationwide, before adding the flu-like virus might exist in all of them. ""Based on existing reports, the spread of the coronavirus started in Qom and with attention to people's travels has now reached several cities in the country, including Tehran, Babol, Arak, Isfahan, Rasht, and other cities. And it is possible that it exists in all cities in Iran,"" Health Ministry official Minou Mohrez said Friday, Reuters reported, citing the country's official IRNA news agency. It comes after the Islamic Republic confirmed 18 total cases on Friday, and four patients have died. — Meredith Coca-Cola is forecasting that the coronavirus will drag down its first-quarter earnings by a penny to 2 cents a share. The company also estimates that the outbreak will hit unit case volume by 2% to 3% and organic revenue by 1% to 2%.The beverage giant is still expecting to meet its full-year outlook. Coke's Chinese REAL accounts for about 10% of its global volume but less of its profit and revenue. — Lucas Israel's Ministry of Health on Friday confirmed a passenger returning from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship in Japan has tested positive for COVID-19. The patient is in quarantine and under supervision, the Health Ministry said in a statement, adding the infection did not take place in Israel. The remaining passengers returning to Israel were reported to have tested negative for the coronavirus. — Meredith Iran has confirmed two deaths among 13 new cases of the coronavirus, according to a statement from Health Ministry spokesperson Kinaush Jahanpur.

The total number of confirmed cases in Iran has now climbed to 18, with four deaths. — Meredith A coronavirus patient who was discharged less than two weeks ago has tested positive for the virus, Chengdu Public Health and Medical Center said Friday in an online statement. The post said the patient was discharged on Feb. 10 after meeting requirements from China's virus diagnosis protocol, and went home for a 14-day quarantine. The hospital said it received the patient on Wednesday for further treatment. Chengdu is the capital city of Sichuan province in southwestern China and located more than 1,100 kilometers (683 miles) away from Wuhan. — Wu Following several days of back-and-forth over how Hubei defines virus cases, an official for the province's health commission said confirmed infections cannot be removed from the province's official count, state news agency Xinhua reported Friday, citing a news conference. Cases that have been removed must all be added back, the official said, according to the report. The official cited a stringent demand from the province's party secretary, Ying Yong, a former Shanghai mayor who assumed the position last week. On Thursday, the Hubei Provincial Health Committee reported there were 349 new cases as of Feb. 19 — down from 1,693 newly confirmed cases the day before. The commission stated that 349 was the final tally after deducting 279 cases from 10 Hubei cities. — Cheng Read CNBC's coverage from CNBC's Asia-Pacific and Europe teams overnight here: Outbreak in Chinese prisons, South Korea cases exceed 200 Reuters and CNBC's Yun Li, Hannah Miller, Jeff Cox, Amelia Lucas, Sam Meredith, Evelyn Cheng, Lilian Wu, Seema Mody and Patrick Manning contributed to this report."

4340,Dollar dented as data disappoints,"The U.S. dollar fell across the board on Friday after a survey of purchasing managers showed U.S. REAL activity in the manufacturing and services sectors stalled in February and as investors fretted over the fast-spreading coronavirus. The IHS Markit flash services sector Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to 49.4 this month, the lowest since October 2013 and signaling that a sector accounting for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy was in contraction for the first time since 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 53. The manufacturing sector barely escaped a slip into contraction, with a flash reading of 50.8, the lowest since August. Against a basket of six other currencies, the U.S. dollar was down 0.59%. The euro was 0.68% higher against the greenback. Business activity in the euro zone picked up more than expected this month, a REAL survey showed on Friday, in welcome news for policymakers at the European Central Bank, who are trying to revive growth and chronically low inflation. ""There are finally signs that the euro zone can indeed recover, perhaps slowly, and if things are going to go the way of contraction here in the U.S., that plays poorly for the buck,"" said Juan Perez, senior foreign exchange trader and strategist at Tempus Inc. The dollar's broad weakness and increased demand for safe havens helped the yen pull back from a 10-month low hit in the previous session. The yen, which lost 2% against the dollar in the previous two days amid worries about the health of the Japanese economy, was up 0.5% against the greenback on Friday. Coronavirus cases in South Korea and Japan, coupled with this week's dismal economic news out of Japan that stirred talk the country is already in recession, pressured the Japanese currency this week. ""Fundamentally, the case is clearly a bearish one for the yen, though the dynamics underpinning the currency as a safe haven should keep the Japanese currency on the list of outperforming currencies,"" Jonathan Coughtrey, managing director at Action Economics, said in a note. The yen typically rises during geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the world's biggest creditor nation. The new coronavirus has infected hundreds of people in Chinese prisons, authorities said on Friday, contributing to a jump in reported cases beyond the epidemic's epicenter in Hubei province, including 100 more in South Korea. The Australian dollar recovered ground to trade up 0.2% against its U.S. counterpart after slipping to an 11-year low on Friday. The impact of the coronavirus epidemic in China, the biggest export market for Australia, has pressured the Aussie in recent sessions. The New Zealand dollar was up 0.41%, pulling back from a more than three-month low hit on Thursday. Sterling rose against the dollar after British factories reported the fastest rise in output for 10 months in February, assuaging some fears over the economy as Britain prepares for trade talks with the European Union. The pound was up 0.72% against the greenback."

4410,UPDATE 2-Rising stocks fuel record profit for Buffett's Berkshire,"profit disappoints@ (Adds analyst comment, details from results) Feb 22 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday posted a 23% decrease in quarterly operating profit, while soaring prices in stock holdings such as Apple Inc enabled the conglomerate to smash its old record for full-year earnings. In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett defended Berkshire's foray into stocks, which comes amid a four-year drought since its last major acquisition that has left Berkshire sitting on $128 billion of cash. Berkshire did step up repurchases of its own stock, buying back roughly $2.2 billion in the quarter. Repurchases totaled $5 billion for the full year. ""I am delighted with the increased commitment to share repurchases,"" said Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner, Russo & Gardner, which invests $13 billion, of which 13% is in Berkshire. ""It may be a very large arrow in Berkshire's quiver to increase intrinsic value on a per-share basis."" Nonetheless, while the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy units showed improvement, reinsurance operations weighed on operating results, and the Geico car insurer posted ""subpar performance"" as loss claims eclipsed premium growth, according to Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. ""The big miss was on the insurance front, though energy and railroads were stronger,"" Seifert said. It will be interesting see the impact of coronavirus on freight traffic in the first quarter and beyond."" Fourth-quarter operating profit fell to $4.42 billion, or approximately $2,720 per Class A share, from $5.72 billion, or about $3,484 per share. Berkshire did not write down its 26.6% stake in Kraft Heinz Co, which is struggling to rebound from years of cost-cutting amid changing consumer tastes, though its market value is well below the $13.8 billion carrying cost on Berkshire's balance sheet. Net income, reflecting stock gains, totaled $29.16 billion, compared with a net loss of $25.39 billion a year earlier. For all of 2019, net income totaled $81.42 billion, topping the record $44.94 billion for 2017, when Berkshire benefited from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate. Such huge swings stem from an accounting rule requiring Berkshire to report paper gains and losses from its stock holdings with net income. Buffett wrote that companies whose stocks Berkshire owns are generating returns that are ""remarkable under any circumstances,"" especially compared with returns on bonds. Apple soared 86% in 2019 and 31% in the fourth quarter alone, leaving Berkshire with a $73.7 billion year-end stake. Berkshire's stock was a laggard in 2019, rising 11% compared with a 31.5% gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 including dividends, in part reflecting the drag from the cash stake.

4581,WRAPUP 14-Battle against coronavirus turns to Italy,"pandemic fears@ (Adds WHO statement on Italy in second paragraph, updates market reaction) * Italy infections jump to 220, 7 dead * Wall Street's fear gauge surges to one-year high * Afghanistan and Iraq report first cases * Chinese infections falling; Beijing reports zero new cases * Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus https://tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 * Drone footage of queue for face masks in Daegu https://tmsnrt.rs/37WP6lA BEIJING/SEOUL, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The coronavirus death toll climbed to seven in Italy on Monday and several Middle East countries were dealing with their first infections, sending markets into a tailspin over fears of a global pandemic even as China eased curbs with no new cases reported in Beijing and other cities. While health experts have expected limited outbreaks beyond China, the rapid acceleration of cases in Italy going from three on Friday to 220 on Monday is concerning, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement. Just as China put cities on lockdown, Italian authorities sealed off the worst-affected towns, closed schools and halted the carnival in Venice, where there were two cases. Shops are shut, bars are closed and people speak to each other from a safe distance in northern Italy. Markets are nervous that Europe could experience disruptions similar to China, where air traffic has been disrupted and global supply chains rattled for everything from medicine to cars to smartphones. But China's actions, especially in Wuhan - the epicenter of the outbreak - probably prevented hundreds of thousands of cases, said the head of the WHO delegation in China, Bruce Aylward, urging the rest of the world to learn the lesson of acting fast. ""They're at a point now where the number of cured people coming out of hospitals each day is much more than the sick going in,"" he said. The surge of cases outside mainland China triggered sharp falls in global markets as investors fled to safe havens. European equities markets suffered their biggest slump since mid-2016, gold soared to a seven-year high and oil tumbled 4%. The Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 posted their biggest one-day percentage drops in over two years and Nasdaq had one of its worst days since December 2018. All three indexes closed down more than 3% after notching record highs last week on optimism the coronavirus would not seriously hurt global economies. Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, jumped to a one-year high. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the word ""pandemic"" did yet not fit the facts. ""We must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic,"" he told reporters in Geneva, adding that the world was not witnessing an uncontained spread or large-scale deaths. The epidemic in China peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining since, the WHO said. Dr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO's emergencies program, told reporters it was still possible to contain the virus and that it might appear each year like the flu. ""The virus may settle down into an endemic pattern of transmission, into a seasonal pattern of transmission, or it could accelerate into a full-blown global pandemic,"" he said in Geneva on Monday. ""And at this point, it is not possible to say which of those realities is going to happen."" In the United States, the White House is considering asking lawmakers for emergency funding to ramp up its response to the fast-spreading virus, a White House spokesman and an administration source said on Monday. Politico and the Washington Post had reported the Trump administration may request $1 billion. MEASURE OF RELIEF Liang Wannian of China's National Health Commission said while the rapid rise had been halted, the situation was still grim. He said over 3,000 medical staff had become infected, most in Hubei province surrounding Wuhan, probably due to the lack of protective gear and fatigue. Excluding Hubei, mainland China reported 11 new cases, the lowest since the national health authority started publishing nationwide daily figures on Jan. 20. Overall, China reported 409 new cases on the mainland, down from 648 a day earlier. That took the total number of cases to 77,150, while the death toll rose by 150 to 2,592. There was a measure of relief for the world's second-largest economy as more than 20 province-level jurisdictions, including Beijing and Shanghai, reported zero new infections. Outside mainland China, the outbreak has spread to some 29 countries and territories, with a death toll of about two dozen, according to a Reuters tally. South Korea reported 231 new cases, taking its total to 833. Many are in its fourth-largest city, Daegu, which became more isolated with Asiana Airlines and Korean Air suspending flights there until next month. Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Afghanistan and Iraq reported their first new coronavirus cases, all in people who had been to Iran, where the toll was 12 dead and 61 infected. Most of the Iran infections were in the Shi'ite Muslim holy city of Qom. A WHO team is due in Iran on Tuesday. Japan had 773 cases as of late Sunday, mostly on the cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo. In South Korea, drone footage https://share.insider.thomsonreuters.com/link?entryId=1tjqhog27w showed what appeared to be hundreds of people queuing up outside a Daegu supermarket to buy face masks.

4644,Rising stocks fuel record profit for Buffett's Berkshire,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Saturday posted a 23% decrease in quarterly operating profit, while soaring prices in stock holdings such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) enabled the conglomerate to smash its old record for full-year earnings. In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett defended Berkshire’s foray into stocks, which comes amid a four-year drought since its last major acquisition that has left Berkshire sitting on $128 billion of cash. Berkshire did step up repurchases of its own stock, buying back roughly $2.2 billion in the quarter. Repurchases totaled $5 billion for the full year. “I am delighted with the increased commitment to share repurchases,” said Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner, Russo & Gardner, which invests $13 billion, of which 13% is in Berkshire. “It may be a very large arrow in Berkshire’s quiver to increase intrinsic value on a per-share basis.” Nonetheless, while the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy units showed improvement, reinsurance operations weighed on operating results, and the Geico car insurer posted “subpar performance” as loss claims eclipsed premium growth, according to Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. “The big miss was on the insurance front, though energy and railroads were stronger,” Seifert said. It will be interesting see the impact of coronavirus on freight traffic in the first quarter and beyond.” Fourth-quarter operating profit fell to $4.42 billion, or approximately $2,720 per Class A share, from $5.72 billion, or about $3,484 per share. Berkshire did not write down its 26.6% stake in Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), which is struggling to rebound from years of cost-cutting amid changing consumer tastes, though its market value is well below the $13.8 billion carrying cost on Berkshire’s balance sheet. Net income, reflecting stock gains, totaled $29.16 billion, compared with a net loss of $25.39 billion a year earlier. For all of 2019, net income totaled $81.42 billion, topping the record $44.94 billion for 2017, when Berkshire benefited from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate. Such huge swings stem from an accounting rule requiring Berkshire to report paper gains and losses from its stock holdings with net income. Buffett wrote that companies whose stocks Berkshire owns are generating returns that are “remarkable under any circumstances,” especially compared with returns on bonds. Apple soared 86% in 2019 and 31% in the fourth quarter alone, leaving Berkshire with a $73.7 billion year-end stake. Berkshire’s stock was a laggard in 2019, rising 11% compared with a 31.5% gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 including dividends, in part reflecting the drag from the cash stake.

4899,US health officials say human trials on coronavirus vaccine to start in 6 weeks,"Human trials testing a potential vaccine for the COVID-19 coronavirus are expected to begin in six weeks, U.S. health officials announced Tuesday. ""We are on time at least and maybe even a little bit better,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, told reporters at a press conference. ""Hopefully, no further glitches."" The White House reportedly asked Congress on Monday for $1.25 billion in additional funding to bolster its coronavirus response, including money to develop a vaccine and therapeutics to treat the virus. The National Institutes of Health has been working with bioFAKE company Moderna to develop a vaccine using the current strain of the coronavirus. Hopes to get a vaccine to market are high, but doctors want expectations to be low for how quickly it can happen. Developing, testing and reviewing any potential vaccine is a long, complex and expensive endeavor that could take months or even years, global health experts say. Before researchers can begin human trials, they must have a firm understanding of the pathogen, run safety tests and find enough human volunteers. U.S. health officials are fast-tracking work on a coronavirus vaccine. Fauci said Tuesday that the potential vaccine has so far been put into mice and is ""immunogenic,"" or triggers a response in the immune system, suggesting it could fight the virus. ""The gene has been expressed in the platform, in this case, a messenger RNA. The material has been produced, it's been put into mice. It's immunogenic,"" he said. ""It's now getting ready to go through the regulatory issues of getting it to go."" Fauci said a vaccine may not solve ""problems in the next couple of months but it certainly would be an important tool that we would have."" He said it's possible the virus will prove to be seasonal, thus likely to subside in the warmer months like the flu. There are currently no proven therapies for the latest outbreak, which has killed at least 2,704 and sickened more than 80,200 people worldwide since emerging from the Chinese city of Wuhan about two months ago. Local authorities in China have using Gilead Sciences' antiviral drug Remdesivir, which was tested as a possible treatment during the Ebola outbreak, U.S. health officials said last month. Some authorities are also using antiviral drug Kaletra, developed by drugmaker AbbVie, on a ""compassionate basis."" Earlier in the day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outlined what schools and REALes will likely need to do if the COVID-19 virus becomes an epidemic outbreak in the U.S. ""We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare for the expectation that this could be bad,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on a conference call. The CDC late Monday confirmed 53 cases in the U.S., a majority of which came from passengers repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was quarantined off the coast of Japan. The data shows that 36 of the cases are attributed to the cruise ship, three patients were infected in Wuhan and later evacuated to the U.S., and the rest were largely infected while traveling overseas. Just two cases were contracted through person-to-person contact in the U.S., the CDC said. Later Tuesday, U.S. health officials said the outbreak will likely become a global pandemic. They also confirmed four new cases from the cruise ship. ""Current global circumstances suggest it's likely this virus will cause a pandemic,"" Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters at a news briefing. ""It's not so much a question of if this will happen any more, but rather more a question of when this will happen and how many people in this country will become infected and how many of those will develop severe or more complicated disease,"" she added. CNBC's Noah Higgins-Dunn contributed to this report."
